                          Contributing documentation#

   Thank you for your interest to help improve documentation in the Nix
   ecosystem! This project would not be possible without your support.

Getting started#

   Check the overview of documentation resources. Documentation contributions
   should follow the style guide.

   Get in touch with the Nix documentation team if you need more guidance.

   Important

   If you cannot contribute time, consider donating to the NixOS Foundation’s
   documentation project on Open Collective to fund ongoing maintenance and
   development of reference documentation and learning materials.

Feedback#

   Feedback is also a valuable contribution. Please share your thoughts in
   the Documentation category on Discourse.

  Nix beginners#

   Try to use official documentation as your primary resource, however
   incomplete it may appear.

   Please open issues and report all problems or questions that arise. Also
   state your learning goals and the paths you have taken so far.

   Sharing your first-hand experience will help guide our efforts and solve
   recurrent problems with documentation for you and everyone else.

  Nix educators#

   You will probably have observed where learners get stuck most often, and
   which typical needs and questions they have. You may have your own written
   notes for classes, trainings, or presentations.

   Please share your experience to help us improve upstream documentation and
   beginner materials, so you can focus on providing the best value to your
   students.

  Domain experts using Nix#

   If you are proficient in applying Nix to a domain-specific problem, and
   want to share your expertise on best practices, please check the existing
   content.

     * Does existing material on your subject meet your standards?

     * How could we improve it?

     * Is there a popular application of Nix’ capabilities not yet covered?

     * We would be glad to incorporate your insights.

Licensing and attribution#

   When opening pull requests with your own contributions, you agree to
   licensing your work under CC-BY-SA 4.0.

   When adding material made by others, make sure it has a license that
   permits this. In that case, unambiguously state source, authors, and
   license in the newly added content. Ideally, notify the authors before
   using their work.

   Add the original author as co-author to the first commit of your pull
   request, which should contain the original document verbatim, so we can
   track authorship and changes through version history.

   Using free licenses other than CC-BY-SA 4.0 is possible for individual
   documents. By contributing changes to those documents you agree to license
   your work accordingly.

   Note

   If you have written a tutorial or guide related to Nix, please consider
   licensing it under CC-BY-SA 4.0! This will allow us to feature your work
   as official documentation if it complements or improves upon existing
   materials.
