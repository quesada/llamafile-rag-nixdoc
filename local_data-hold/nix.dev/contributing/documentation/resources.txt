                            Documentation resources#

   This is an overview of documentation resources for Nix, Nixpkgs, and
   NixOS, with suggestions how you can help to improve them.

Reference manuals#

   The reference manuals document interfaces and behavior, show examples, and
   define component-specific terms.

     * Nix reference manual

          * source

          * issues

          * pull requests

     * Nixpkgs reference manual

          * source

          * issues

          * pull requests

     * NixOS reference manual

          * source

          * issues

          * pull requests

   The respective manual sections are maintained by developers of the code
   being documented.

   How to help:

     * Add links to definitions, commands, options, etc. where only the name
       is mentioned

     * Ensure consistent use of technical terms

     * Check that examples are self-contained and follow best practices

     * Expand on sections that appear incomplete

NixOS Wiki#

   NixOS Wiki is a collection of NixOS user guides, configuration examples,
   and troubleshooting tips. It is meant to be complementary to the NixOS
   reference manual.

   It is collectively edited by the NixOS user community.

   How to help:

     * Improve discoverability by adding categorisation and links to
       reference documentation

     * Remove redundant or outdated information

     * Add guides and sample configurations for your use cases

nix.dev#

   The purpose of nix.dev (source) is to orient beginners in the Nix
   ecosystem.

   The documentation team maintains nix.dev as editors.

   How to help:

     * Work on open issues

     * Review pull requests

     * Add guides or tutorials following the proposed outline. New articles
       can be based on videos such as:

          * The Nix Hour recordings

          * some of the ~100 NixCon recordings

          * Nix video guides by @jonringer.

          * Summer of Nix 2022 talks

       Since writing a guide or tutorial is a lot of work, please make sure
       to coordinate with maintainers, for example by commenting on or
       opening an issue.

Discourse#

   Nix users exchange information and support each other on these Discourse
   categories:

     * Help

     * Guides

     * Links

   How to help:

     * Ask informed questions, show your work

     * Answer other people’s questions

     * Address recurrent questions by updating or adding a NixOS Wiki
       article, nix.dev guide or tutorial, or one of the reference manuals.

     * Encourage and help people to incorporate their insights into official
       documentation

Nix Pills#

   Nix Pills is a series of low-level tutorials on building software packages
   with Nix, showing in detail how Nixpkgs is made from first principles.

   The Nix Pills are not actively maintained.
