                                  Description

   nix flake provides subcommands for creating, modifying and querying Nix
   flakes. Flakes are the unit for packaging Nix code in a reproducible and
   discoverable way. They can have dependencies on other flakes, making it
   possible to have multi-repository Nix projects.

   A flake is a filesystem tree (typically fetched from a Git repository or a
   tarball) that contains a file named flake.nix in the root directory.
   flake.nix specifies some metadata about the flake such as dependencies
   (called inputs), as well as its outputs (the Nix values such as packages
   or NixOS modules provided by the flake).

                                Flake references

   Flake references (flakerefs) are a way to specify the location of a flake.
   These have two different forms:

Attribute set representation

   Example:

 {
   type = "github";
   owner = "NixOS";
   repo = "nixpkgs";
 }

   The only required attribute is type. The supported types are listed below.

URL-like syntax

   Example:

 github:NixOS/nixpkgs

   These are used on the command line as a more convenient alternative to the
   attribute set representation. For instance, in the command

 # nix build github:NixOS/nixpkgs#hello

   github:NixOS/nixpkgs is a flake reference (while hello is an output
   attribute). They are also allowed in the inputs attribute of a flake, e.g.

 inputs.nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs";

   is equivalent to

 inputs.nixpkgs = {
   type = "github";
   owner = "NixOS";
   repo = "nixpkgs";
 };

   Following RFC 3986, characters outside of the allowed range (i.e. neither
   reserved characters nor unreserved characters) must be percent-encoded.

  Examples

   Here are some examples of flake references in their URL-like
   representation:

     * nixpkgs: The nixpkgs entry in the flake registry.
     * nixpkgs/a3a3dda3bacf61e8a39258a0ed9c924eeca8e293: The nixpkgs entry in
       the flake registry, with its Git revision overridden to a specific
       value.
     * github:NixOS/nixpkgs: The master branch of the NixOS/nixpkgs
       repository on GitHub.
     * github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-20.09: The nixos-20.09 branch of the
       nixpkgs repository.
     * github:NixOS/nixpkgs/a3a3dda3bacf61e8a39258a0ed9c924eeca8e293: A
       specific revision of the nixpkgs repository.
     * github:edolstra/nix-warez?dir=blender: A flake in a subdirectory of a
       GitHub repository.
     * git+https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf: A Git repository.
     * git+https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf?ref=master: A specific branch of
       a Git repository.
     * git+https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf?ref=master&rev=f34751b88bd07d7f44f5cd3200fb4122bf916c7e:
       A specific branch and revision of a Git repository.
     * https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf/archive/master.tar.gz: A tarball
       flake.

Path-like syntax

   Flakes corresponding to a local path can also be referred to by a direct
   path reference, either /absolute/path/to/the/flake
   or./relative/path/to/the/flake. Note that the leading ./ is mandatory for
   relative paths. If it is omitted, the path will be interpreted as URL-like
   syntax, which will cause error messages like this:

 error: cannot find flake 'flake:relative/path/to/the/flake' in the flake registries

   The semantic of such a path is as follows:

     * If the directory is part of a Git repository, then the input will be
       treated as a git+file: URL, otherwise it will be treated as a path:
       url;
     * If the directory doesn't contain a flake.nix file, then Nix will
       search for such a file upwards in the file system hierarchy until it
       finds any of:
         1. The Git repository root, or
         2. The filesystem root (/), or
         3. A folder on a different mount point.

   Contrary to URL-like references, path-like flake references can contain
   arbitrary unicode characters (except # and ?).

  Examples

     * .: The flake to which the current directory belongs to.
     * /home/alice/src/patchelf: A flake in some other directory.
     * ./../sub directory/with Ûñî©ôδ€: A flake in another relative directory
       that has Unicode characters in its name.

Flake reference attributes

   The following generic flake reference attributes are supported:

     * dir: The subdirectory of the flake in which flake.nix is located. This
       parameter enables having multiple flakes in a repository or tarball.
       The default is the root directory of the flake.

     * narHash: The hash of the NAR serialisation (in SRI format) of the
       contents of the flake. This is useful for flake types such as tarballs
       that lack a unique content identifier such as a Git commit hash.

   In addition, the following attributes are common to several flake
   reference types:

     * rev: A Git or Mercurial commit hash.

     * ref: A Git or Mercurial branch or tag name.

   Finally, some attribute are typically not specified by the user, but can
   occur in locked flake references and are available to Nix code:

     * revCount: The number of ancestors of the commit rev.

     * lastModified: The timestamp (in seconds since the Unix epoch) of the
       last modification of this version of the flake. For Git/Mercurial
       flakes, this is the commit time of commit rev, while for tarball
       flakes, it's the most recent timestamp of any file inside the tarball.

Types

   Currently the type attribute can be one of the following:

     * indirect: The default. Indirection through the flake registry. These
       have the form

 [flake:]<flake-id>(/<rev-or-ref>(/rev)?)?

       These perform a lookup of <flake-id> in the flake registry. For
       example, nixpkgs and nixpkgs/release-20.09 are indirect flake
       references. The specified rev and/or ref are merged with the entry in
       the registry; see nix registry for details.

       For example, these are valid indirect flake references:

          * nixpkgs
          * nixpkgs/nixos-unstable
          * nixpkgs/a3a3dda3bacf61e8a39258a0ed9c924eeca8e293
          * nixpkgs/nixos-unstable/a3a3dda3bacf61e8a39258a0ed9c924eeca8e293
          * sub/dir (if a flake named sub is in the registry)
     * path: arbitrary local directories. The required attribute path
       specifies the path of the flake. The URL form is

 path:<path>(\?<params>)?

       where path is an absolute path to a directory in the file system
       containing a file named flake.nix.

       If the flake at path is not inside a git repository, the path: prefix
       is implied and can be omitted.

       path generally must be an absolute path. However, on the command line,
       it can be a relative path (e.g. . or ./foo) which is interpreted as
       relative to the current directory. In this case, it must start with .
       to avoid ambiguity with registry lookups (e.g. nixpkgs is a registry
       lookup; ./nixpkgs is a relative path).

       For example, these are valid path flake references:

          * path:/home/user/sub/dir
          * /home/user/sub/dir (if dir/flake.nix is not in a git repository)
          * ./sub/dir (when used on the command line and dir/flake.nix is not
            in a git repository)
     * git: Git repositories. The location of the repository is specified by
       the attribute url.

       They have the URL form

 git(+http|+https|+ssh|+git|+file):(//<server>)?<path>(\?<params>)?

       If path starts with / (or ./ when used as an argument on the command
       line) and is a local path to a git repository, the leading git: or
       +file prefixes are implied and can be omitted.

       The ref attribute defaults to resolving the HEAD reference.

       The rev attribute must denote a commit that exists in the branch or
       tag specified by the ref attribute, since Nix doesn't do a full clone
       of the remote repository by default (and the Git protocol doesn't
       allow fetching a rev without a known ref). The default is the commit
       currently pointed to by ref.

       When git+file is used without specifying ref or rev, files are fetched
       directly from the local path as long as they have been added to the
       Git repository. If there are uncommitted changes, the reference is
       treated as dirty and a warning is printed.

       For example, the following are valid Git flake references:

          * git:/home/user/sub/dir
          * /home/user/sub/dir (if dir/flake.nix is in a git repository)
          * ./sub/dir (when used on the command line and dir/flake.nix is in
            a git repository)
          * git+https://example.org/my/repo
          * git+https://example.org/my/repo?dir=flake1
          * git+ssh://git@github.com/NixOS/nix?ref=v1.2.3
          * git://github.com/edolstra/dwarffs?ref=unstable&rev=e486d8d40e626a20e06d792db8cc5ac5aba9a5b4
          * git+file:///home/my-user/some-repo/some-repo
     * mercurial: Mercurial repositories. The URL form is similar to the git
       type, except that the URL schema must be one of hg+http, hg+https,
       hg+ssh or hg+file.

     * tarball: Tarballs. The location of the tarball is specified by the
       attribute url.

       In URL form, the schema must be tarball+http://, tarball+https:// or
       tarball+file://. If the extension corresponds to a known archive
       format (.zip, .tar, .tgz, .tar.gz, .tar.xz, .tar.bz2 or .tar.zst),
       then the tarball+ can be dropped.

     * file: Plain files or directory tarballs, either over http(s) or from
       the local disk.

       In URL form, the schema must be file+http://, file+https:// or
       file+file://. If the extension doesn’t correspond to a known archive
       format (as defined by the tarball fetcher), then the file+ prefix can
       be dropped.

     * github: A more efficient way to fetch repositories from GitHub. The
       following attributes are required:

          * owner: The owner of the repository.

          * repo: The name of the repository.

       These are downloaded as tarball archives, rather than through Git.
       This is often much faster and uses less disk space since it doesn't
       require fetching the entire history of the repository. On the other
       hand, it doesn't allow incremental fetching (but full downloads are
       often faster than incremental fetches!).

       The URL syntax for github flakes is:

 github:<owner>/<repo>(/<rev-or-ref>)?(\?<params>)?

       <rev-or-ref> specifies the name of a branch or tag (ref), or a commit
       hash (rev). Note that unlike Git, GitHub allows fetching by commit
       hash without specifying a branch or tag.

       You can also specify host as a parameter, to point to a custom GitHub
       Enterprise server.

       Some examples:

          * github:edolstra/dwarffs
          * github:edolstra/dwarffs/unstable
          * github:edolstra/dwarffs/d3f2baba8f425779026c6ec04021b2e927f61e31
          * github:internal/project?host=company-github.example.org
     * gitlab: Similar to github, is a more efficient way to fetch GitLab
       repositories. The following attributes are required:

          * owner: The owner of the repository.

          * repo: The name of the repository.

       Like github, these are downloaded as tarball archives.

       The URL syntax for gitlab flakes is:

       gitlab:<owner>/<repo>(/<rev-or-ref>)?(\?<params>)?

       <rev-or-ref> works the same as github. Either a branch or tag name
       (ref), or a commit hash (rev) can be specified.

       Since GitLab allows for self-hosting, you can specify host as a
       parameter, to point to any instances other than gitlab.com.

       Some examples:

          * gitlab:veloren/veloren
          * gitlab:veloren/veloren/master
          * gitlab:veloren/veloren/80a4d7f13492d916e47d6195be23acae8001985a
          * gitlab:openldap/openldap?host=git.openldap.org

       When accessing a project in a (nested) subgroup, make sure to
       URL-encode any slashes, i.e. replace / with %2F:

          * gitlab:veloren%2Fdev/rfcs
     * sourcehut: Similar to github, is a more efficient way to fetch
       SourceHut repositories. The following attributes are required:

          * owner: The owner of the repository (including leading ~).

          * repo: The name of the repository.

       Like github, these are downloaded as tarball archives.

       The URL syntax for sourcehut flakes is:

       sourcehut:<owner>/<repo>(/<rev-or-ref>)?(\?<params>)?

       <rev-or-ref> works the same as github. Either a branch or tag name
       (ref), or a commit hash (rev) can be specified.

       Since SourceHut allows for self-hosting, you can specify host as a
       parameter, to point to any instances other than git.sr.ht.

       Currently, ref name resolution only works for Git repositories. You
       can refer to Mercurial repositories by simply changing host to
       hg.sr.ht (or any other Mercurial instance). With the caveat that you
       must explicitly specify a commit hash (rev).

       Some examples:

          * sourcehut:~misterio/nix-colors
          * sourcehut:~misterio/nix-colors/main
          * sourcehut:~misterio/nix-colors?host=git.example.org
          * sourcehut:~misterio/nix-colors/182b4b8709b8ffe4e9774a4c5d6877bf6bb9a21c
          * sourcehut:~misterio/nix-colors/21c1a380a6915d890d408e9f22203436a35bb2de?host=hg.sr.ht

                                  Flake format

   As an example, here is a simple flake.nix that depends on the Nixpkgs
   flake and provides a single package (i.e. an installable derivation):

 {
   description = "A flake for building Hello World";

   inputs.nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-20.03";

   outputs = { self, nixpkgs }: {

     packages.x86_64-linux.default =
       # Notice the reference to nixpkgs here.
       with import nixpkgs { system = "x86_64-linux"; };
       stdenv.mkDerivation {
         name = "hello";
         src = self;
         buildPhase = "gcc -o hello ./hello.c";
         installPhase = "mkdir -p $out/bin; install -t $out/bin hello";
       };

   };
 }

   The following attributes are supported in flake.nix:

     * description: A short, one-line description of the flake.

     * inputs: An attrset specifying the dependencies of the flake (described
       below).

     * outputs: A function that, given an attribute set containing the
       outputs of each of the input flakes keyed by their identifier, yields
       the Nix values provided by this flake. Thus, in the example above,
       inputs.nixpkgs contains the result of the call to the outputs function
       of the nixpkgs flake.

       In addition to the outputs of each input, each input in inputs also
       contains some metadata about the inputs. These are:

          * outPath: The path in the Nix store of the flake's source tree.
            This way, the attribute set can be passed to import as if it was
            a path, as in the example above (import nixpkgs).

          * rev: The commit hash of the flake's repository, if applicable.

          * revCount: The number of ancestors of the revision rev. This is
            not available for github repositories, since they're fetched as
            tarballs rather than as Git repositories.

          * lastModifiedDate: The commit time of the revision rev, in the
            format %Y%m%d%H%M%S (e.g. 20181231100934). Unlike revCount, this
            is available for both Git and GitHub repositories, so it's useful
            for generating (hopefully) monotonically increasing version
            strings.

          * lastModified: The commit time of the revision rev as an integer
            denoting the number of seconds since 1970.

          * narHash: The SHA-256 (in SRI format) of the NAR serialization of
            the flake's source tree.

       The value returned by the outputs function must be an attribute set.
       The attributes can have arbitrary values; however, various nix
       subcommands require specific attributes to have a specific value (e.g.
       packages.x86_64-linux must be an attribute set of derivations built
       for the x86_64-linux platform).

     * nixConfig: a set of nix.conf options to be set when evaluating any
       part of a flake. In the interests of security, only a small set of set
       of options is allowed to be set without confirmation so long as
       accept-flake-config is not enabled in the global configuration:

          * bash-prompt
          * bash-prompt-prefix
          * bash-prompt-suffix
          * flake-registry
          * commit-lockfile-summary

Flake inputs

   The attribute inputs specifies the dependencies of a flake, as an attrset
   mapping input names to flake references. For example, the following
   specifies a dependency on the nixpkgs and import-cargo repositories:

 # A GitHub repository.
 inputs.import-cargo = {
   type = "github";
   owner = "edolstra";
   repo = "import-cargo";
 };

 # An indirection through the flake registry.
 inputs.nixpkgs = {
   type = "indirect";
   id = "nixpkgs";
 };

   Alternatively, you can use the URL-like syntax:

 inputs.import-cargo.url = "github:edolstra/import-cargo";
 inputs.nixpkgs.url = "nixpkgs";

   Each input is fetched, evaluated and passed to the outputs function as a
   set of attributes with the same name as the corresponding input. The
   special input named self refers to the outputs and source tree of this
   flake. Thus, a typical outputs function looks like this:

 outputs = { self, nixpkgs, import-cargo }: {
   ... outputs ...
 };

   It is also possible to omit an input entirely and only list it as expected
   function argument to outputs. Thus,

 outputs = { self, nixpkgs }: ...;

   without an inputs.nixpkgs attribute is equivalent to

 inputs.nixpkgs = {
   type = "indirect";
   id = "nixpkgs";
 };

   Repositories that don't contain a flake.nix can also be used as inputs, by
   setting the input's flake attribute to false:

 inputs.grcov = {
   type = "github";
   owner = "mozilla";
   repo = "grcov";
   flake = false;
 };

 outputs = { self, nixpkgs, grcov }: {
   packages.x86_64-linux.grcov = stdenv.mkDerivation {
     src = grcov;
     ...
   };
 };

   Transitive inputs can be overridden from a flake.nix file. For example,
   the following overrides the nixpkgs input of the nixops input:

 inputs.nixops.inputs.nixpkgs = {
   type = "github";
   owner = "my-org";
   repo = "nixpkgs";
 };

   It is also possible to "inherit" an input from another input. This is
   useful to minimize flake dependencies. For example, the following sets the
   nixpkgs input of the top-level flake to be equal to the nixpkgs input of
   the dwarffs input of the top-level flake:

 inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "dwarffs/nixpkgs";

   The value of the follows attribute is a /-separated sequence of input
   names denoting the path of inputs to be followed from the root flake.

   Overrides and follows can be combined, e.g.

 inputs.nixops.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "dwarffs/nixpkgs";

   sets the nixpkgs input of nixops to be the same as the nixpkgs input of
   dwarffs. It is worth noting, however, that it is generally not useful to
   eliminate transitive nixpkgs flake inputs in this way. Most flakes provide
   their functionality through Nixpkgs overlays or NixOS modules, which are
   composed into the top-level flake's nixpkgs input; so their own nixpkgs
   input is usually irrelevant.

                                   Lock files

   Inputs specified in flake.nix are typically "unlocked" in the sense that
   they don't specify an exact revision. To ensure reproducibility, Nix will
   automatically generate and use a lock file called flake.lock in the
   flake's directory. The lock file contains a graph structure isomorphic to
   the graph of dependencies of the root flake. Each node in the graph
   (except the root node) maps the (usually) unlocked input specifications in
   flake.nix to locked input specifications. Each node also contains some
   metadata, such as the dependencies (outgoing edges) of the node.

   For example, if flake.nix has the inputs in the example above, then the
   resulting lock file might be:

 {
   "version": 7,
   "root": "n1",
   "nodes": {
     "n1": {
       "inputs": {
         "nixpkgs": "n2",
         "import-cargo": "n3",
         "grcov": "n4"
       }
     },
     "n2": {
       "inputs": {},
       "locked": {
         "owner": "edolstra",
         "repo": "nixpkgs",
         "rev": "7f8d4b088e2df7fdb6b513bc2d6941f1d422a013",
         "type": "github",
         "lastModified": 1580555482,
         "narHash": "sha256-OnpEWzNxF/AU4KlqBXM2s5PWvfI5/BS6xQrPvkF5tO8="
       },
       "original": {
         "id": "nixpkgs",
         "type": "indirect"
       }
     },
     "n3": {
       "inputs": {},
       "locked": {

   This graph has 4 nodes: the root flake, and its 3 dependencies. The nodes
   have arbitrary labels (e.g. n1). The label of the root node of the graph
   is specified by the root attribute. Nodes contain the following fields:

     * inputs: The dependencies of this node, as a mapping from input names
       (e.g. nixpkgs) to node labels (e.g. n2).

     * original: The original input specification from flake.lock, as a set
       of builtins.fetchTree arguments.

     * locked: The locked input specification, as a set of builtins.fetchTree
       arguments. Thus, in the example above, when we build this flake, the
       input nixpkgs is mapped to revision
       7f8d4b088e2df7fdb6b513bc2d6941f1d422a013 of the edolstra/nixpkgs
       repository on GitHub.

       It also includes the attribute narHash, specifying the expected
       contents of the tree in the Nix store (as computed by nix hash-path),
       and may include input-type-specific attributes such as the
       lastModified or revCount. The main reason for these attributes is to
       allow flake inputs to be substituted from a binary cache: narHash
       allows the store path to be computed, while the other attributes are
       necessary because they provide information not stored in the store
       path.

     * flake: A Boolean denoting whether this is a flake or non-flake
       dependency. Corresponds to the flake attribute in the inputs attribute
       in flake.nix.

   The original and locked attributes are omitted for the root node. This is
   because we cannot record the commit hash or content hash of the root
   flake, since modifying flake.lock will invalidate these.

   The graph representation of lock files allows circular dependencies
   between flakes. For example, here are two flakes that reference each
   other:

 {
   inputs.b = ... location of flake B ...;
   # Tell the 'b' flake not to fetch 'a' again, to ensure its 'a' is
   # *this* 'a'.
   inputs.b.inputs.a.follows = "";
   outputs = { self, b }: {
     foo = 123 + b.bar;
     xyzzy = 1000;
   };
 }

   and

 {
   inputs.a = ... location of flake A ...;
   inputs.a.inputs.b.follows = "";
   outputs = { self, a }: {
     bar = 456 + a.xyzzy;
   };
 }

   Lock files transitively lock direct as well as indirect dependencies. That
   is, if a lock file exists and is up to date, Nix will not look at the lock
   files of dependencies. However, lock file generation itself does use the
   lock files of dependencies by default.
