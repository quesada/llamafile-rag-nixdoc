                                  First steps

                                  First steps#

   This tutorial series is where you should start learning Nix.

   In these lessons, you will use basic Nix commands to obtain almost any
   piece of software, create development environments on the fly, and learn
   how to make reproducible scripts. You will also learn reading the Nix
   language, and later use it to build portable, reproducible development
   environments.

     * Ad hoc shell environments
     * Reproducible interpreted scripts
     * Declarative shell environments
     * Towards reproducibility: pinning Nixpkgs
