                                 Installation ​

   Nix can be installed in various ways:

    1. As a package manager on macOS, Linux, or WSL.
    2. As the system environment manager on NixOS, a Linux distribution that
       utilizes Nix for system management.

   This book primarily focuses on the usage of NixOS and Flakes. Therefore,
   we will skip content that pertains solely to Nix(such as installation on
   macOS, Linux, or WSL).

   The installation process of NixOS is straightforward, but we won't delve
   into the specifics here. For more information, please visit the official
   download site at https://nixos.org/download.html.

     If you're using macOS, ryan4yin/nix-darwin-kickstarter may be a good
     starting point for you, you can learn how to use Nix with this book and
     take nix-darwin-kickstarter as a start point to build your own Nix
     configuration.
