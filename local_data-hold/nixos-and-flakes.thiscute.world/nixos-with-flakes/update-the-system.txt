                             Updating the System ​

   With Flakes, updating the system is straightforward. Simply execute the
   following commands in /etc/nixos or any other location where you keep the
   configuration:

   [ Submit ]shell

 # Update flake.lock
 nix flake update
 # Or replace only the specific input, such as home-manager:
 nix flake update home-manager
 # Apply the updates
 sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .
 # Or to update flake.lock & apply with one command (i.e. same as running "nix flake update" before)
 sudo nixos-rebuild switch --recreate-lock-file --flake .

   Occasionally, you may encounter a "sha256 mismatch" error when running
   nixos-rebuild switch. This error can be resolved by updating flake.lock
   using nix flake update.
