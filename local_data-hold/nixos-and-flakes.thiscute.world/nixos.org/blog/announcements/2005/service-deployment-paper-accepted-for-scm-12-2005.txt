                  Service deployment paper accepted for SCM-12

                  Service deployment paper accepted for SCM-12

   The paper “Service Configuration Management” (accepted at the 12th
   International Workshop on Software Configuration Management) describes how
   we can rather easily deploy “services” (e.g., complete webserver
   configurations such as our Subversion server) through Nix by treating the
   non-component parts (such as configuration files, control scripts and
   static data) as components that are built by Nix expressions. The result
   is that all advantages that Nix offers to software deployment also extend
   to service deployment, such as the ability to easily have multiple
   configuration side by side, to roll back configurations, and to identify
   the precise dependencies of a configuration.
