                             NixOS progress report

   Published on Wed May 02 2007

                             NixOS progress report

   KDE logo We now have KDE running on NixOS (obligatory screenshot). Just
   kdebase for now (Martin Bravenboer already added kdelibs a long time ago
   so that we could run the wonderful KCachegrind), but it contains all the
   important stuff (Konqueror, KDesktop, Kicker, Konsole, Control Center,
   etc.).

   In related news, we can safely say that, rumours to the contrary
   notwithstanding, NixOS is not an April Fools’ Joke.
