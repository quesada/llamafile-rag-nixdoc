                             NixOS progress report

   NixOS screenshot Wine now runs on NixOS! Finally we can run all those
   legacy applications… Thanks to Michael Raskin for adding Wine and a
   NPTL-enabled Glibc (which Wine seems to need). This is a nice application
   of purely functional package composition, by the way: Wine didn’t work
   with the standard Glibc in Nixpkgs, so we just pass it another Glibc at
   build time.

   In other news, Nix 0.11 and Nixpkgs 0.11 will be released soon.
