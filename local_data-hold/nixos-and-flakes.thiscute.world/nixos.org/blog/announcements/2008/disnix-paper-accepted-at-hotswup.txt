                        DisNix paper accepted at HotSWUp

   The paper “Atomic Upgrading of Distributed Systems” (by Sander van der
   Burg, Eelco Dolstra and Merijn de Jonge) has been accepted for
   presentation at the First ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Software Upgrades
   (HotSWUp). A draft of the paper is available. It describes Sander’s
   master’s thesis research on DisNix, an extension to Nix that allows
   deployment and upgrading of distributed systems from a single declarative
   description. We will continue this research in the Jacquard PDS project,
   which has now started. (We still have an opening for a PhD student or a
   postdoc; please contact us if you’re interested.)
