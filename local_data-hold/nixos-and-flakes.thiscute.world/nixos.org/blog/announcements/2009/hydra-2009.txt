                                     Hydra

                                     Hydra

   Nix and NixOS releases are now built in Hydra, the new Nix-based
   continuous build system. Hydra replaces our old Nix-based build farm,
   which will be phased out soon. There are several advantages over the old
   build farm: the build tasks for a project are scheduled and published
   separately, so that for instance a (fast) tarball build doesn’t have to
   wait for a (slow) Cygwin build; build results are stored in a database,
   which will enable all sorts of interesting queries; better error
   reporting; a better web interface; and much more. We have written a draft
   paper about Hydra. There are some instructions available about how to set
   up your own Hydra server.
