                            KDE 4.2 in Nixpkgs/NixOS

   Published on Thu May 07 2009

                            KDE 4.2 in Nixpkgs/NixOS

   KDE 4.2 screenshot We now have a fairly complete set of KDE 4.2 packages
   in Nixpkgs and NixOS. Previously we had KDE 3.5, but it was rather
   incomplete: just kdelibs and kdebase. Now we have all that desktop
   goodness, such as kdemultimedia, kdenetwork and kdegames. You can enable
   KDE 4 in NixOS by setting the services.xserver.sessionType option to kde4.
   Thanks go to Yury G. Kudryashov, Andrew Morsillo and Sander van der Burg
   for doing the hard work on adding KDE 4 to Nixpkgs. (Screenshot 1,
