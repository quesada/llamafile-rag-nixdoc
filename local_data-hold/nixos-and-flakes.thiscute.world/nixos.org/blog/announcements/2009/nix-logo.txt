                                    Nix logo

                                    Nix logo

   Nix logo Long overdue, the Nix project finally has a logo! The logo was
   originally created by Simon Frankau for the Haskell logo competition, who
   kindly gave us permission to use it for the Nix project. (The snowflake
   motif is even more appropriate for Nix, because nix is Latin for snow.)
   Any further modifications are entirely our fault.
