                   ISSRE paper on NixOS-based system testing

                   ISSRE paper on NixOS-based system testing

   The paper “Automating System Tests Using Declarative Virtual Machines” (by
   Sander van der Burg and Eelco Dolstra) has been accepted for presentation
   at the 21st IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability
   Engineering (ISSRE 2010). It describes how system tests with complex
   requirements on the environment (such as remote machines, network
   topologies, system services or root privileges) can be written succinctly
   using declarative specifications of the machines needed by the test
   environment. From these specifications we can automatically instantiate
   (networks of) virtual machines. This is what we use for automated
   regression testing of NixOS itself. A draft of the paper is available.
