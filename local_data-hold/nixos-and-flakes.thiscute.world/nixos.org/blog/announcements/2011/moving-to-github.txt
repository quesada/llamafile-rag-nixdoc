                                Moving to GitHub

   Published on Mon Nov 28 2011

                                Moving to GitHub

   The NixOS project is (slowly) migrating from Subversion to Git! The master
   repositories will be hosted in the NixOS organization on GitHub. For the
   moment, just a few subprojects have been migrated, such as Hydra and
   Charon. Thanks to Tianyi Cui for donating the NixOS GitHub organization.
