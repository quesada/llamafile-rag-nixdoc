                              NixOS 13.10 released

   Published on Sun Dec 01 2013

                              NixOS 13.10 released

   We have released NixOS 13.10, the first stable branch of NixOS. Its goal
   is to provide a safe branch for production environments that need bug
   fixes and security updates, but not the potentially destabilising changes
   that sometimes occur on the unstable branch. You can get NixOS 13.10 ISOs
   and VirtualBox appliances from the download page. See the announcement for
   more information. For information on how to switch an existing NixOS
   machine from the unstable channel to 13.10, check out the manual section
   on upgrading.
