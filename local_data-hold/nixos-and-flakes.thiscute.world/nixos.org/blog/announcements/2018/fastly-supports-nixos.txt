                             Fastly supports NixOS

                             Fastly supports NixOS

   We are happy to announce that we have moved our binary cache to Fastly.
   Fastly is a big supporter of open source projects and now NixOS is one of
   them! Fastly provides us with CDN capability, which previously was running
   on AWS CloudFront. Big thanks go to Fastly, in particular Tom Denniston
   and Elaine Greenberg, our friends at Infor and Packet.com and Graham
   Christensen for making this possible.
