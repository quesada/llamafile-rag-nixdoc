  My Reflections and Closing

   Being release manager for 20.03 has been a poignant moment for me in being
   part of NixOS. I had my goals that I set out before I was appointed, but I
   was really surprised how respected I am in the community. My primary goal
   was “work collaboratively with all participants in the NixOS project and
   being supportive of their efforts”. I feel I ✨ shine best in that dynamic
   in the project, so this really was perfect for me. I hope releasing NixOS
   has felt better for those involved. With the seeds I’ve planted it should
   continue to bloom this way.

   I’d like to thank Samuel Leathers, my co-release manager, for his
   congruent effervescence and guidance; Graham Christensen for his
   organizational encouragement; and obviously every last person I got to
   work with. Thanks ✌️

   In leisure, pause, and experimental grace. worldofpeace.
