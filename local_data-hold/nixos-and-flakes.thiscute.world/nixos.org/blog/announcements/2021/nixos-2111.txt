   Hey everyone, we’re Timothy DeHerrera and Tom Bereknyei, the release
   managers for 21.11. As promised, the latest stable release is here: NixOS
   21.11 “Porcupine”.

   The 21.11 release was possible due to the efforts of 1541 contributors in
   41960 commits. We would especially like to thank our top 10 contributors:
   Sandro Jäckel, Fabian Affolter, Martin Weinelt, figsoda, Artturin, Mario
   Rodas, Bobby Rong, Jörg Thalheim, Robert Schütz, Michael Weiss.

   NixOS is already known as the most up to date distribution and is in the
   top three by total number of packages and we expect this trend to
   continue.

  Stabilization Contributors

   Stabilization of the NixOS happens a month before the planned release. The
   goal is to have as little as possible continuous integration (Hydra) jobs
   failing before the release is cut.

   Individuals who contributed to stabilizing this release: Fabian Affolter,
   Sandro Jäckel, figsoda, Sergei Trofimovich, Artturin, Alyssa Ross, Thiago
   Kenji Okada, Lukas Epple, Tredwell, Bernardo Meurer, and 477 others!

  Special Thanks

   Thanks to Domen Kožar for revitalizing the Darwin support effort. Jon
   Ringer for guiding the release process since NixOS 20.09. Vladimír Čunát
   and Martin Weinelt for their continued efforts managing and stabilizing
   staging. Thanks to Graham Christensen for organizing with Equinix Metal to
   ensure we head enough compute resources.

  Reflections and Closing

   The influx of additional interest in Nix/NixOS is exciting to see. The
   fairly smooth release cycle is due to the dedication and time of all the
   volunteers in the community. The continued growth and improvements have
   been incredible to witness.
