                          NixOS Community Survey 2022

   Published on Tue Mar 01 2022

                          NixOS Community Survey 2022

   The NixOS Marketing Team is pleased to announce the first offical NixOS
   Community Survey. Please take 5-10 minutes to complete it.

   Since the Nix community has been growing faster and larger every month,
   it’s gotten harder to understand who makes up the community and what
   everyone cares about. So we’re conducting this survey to improve our
   understanding of those questions. We hope to use your responses to develop
   Nix, NixOS, and Nixpkgs to match your needs and come up with new ideas for
   growing and serving the community. And we’ll publish major findings on
   Discourse and nixos.org.

   All the questions are optional, and all responses are automatically
   anonymized. We will NOT collect your name, phone number, GitHub handle, IP
   address, or any other identifying information.

   The questions in the survey cover:

     * Your background (e.g. What region of the world are you from?)
     * The projects you use in the ecosystem (e.g. Are you using NixOS?)
     * How you use the projects (e.g. Do you use Nix in production servers?)
     * What you like and dislike about the projects (e.g. What do you think
       is already great about Nix? What do you think contributors should
       focus on improving?)

   This is our first time running a survey like this, so we’re also looking
   for feedback on the survey itself to understand how we can do this better
   in the future! Thanks!
