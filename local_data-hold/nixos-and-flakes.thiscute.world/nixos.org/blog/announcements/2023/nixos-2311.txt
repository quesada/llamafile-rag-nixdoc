   Hey everyone, we are figsoda and Ryan Lahfa, the release managers for this
   stable release and we are very proud to announce the public availability
   of NixOS 23.11 “Tapir”.

   This release will receive bugfixes and security updates for seven months

   The 23.11 release was made possible due to the efforts of 2162
   contributors, who authored 40024 commits since the previous release. Our
   thanks go the contributors who also take care of the continued stability
   and security of our stable release.

   NixOS is already known as the most up to date distribution while also
   being the distribution with the most packages. This release saw 9147 new
   packages and 18700 updated packages in Nixpkgs. We also removed 4015
   packages in an effort to keep the package set maintainable and secure. In
   addition to packages the NixOS distribution also features modules and
   tests that make it what it is. This release brought 113 new modules and
   removed 18. In that process we added 1565 options and removed 362.

  GNOME 45

   GNOME has been updated to version 45 “Rīga”, which introduces a new image
   viewer, a new camera app, and more changes. Refer to the release notes for
   more details.

  Default LLVM Version

   The default version for the LLVM package set has been updated to 16 (from
   11) on both Linux and Darwin, which introduced lots of new features and
   improvements. The full lists of changes are available here (LLVM) and here
   (Clang).

  Special Thanks

   We want to personally thank Alejandro Sánchez Medina and Lennart
   Mühlenmeier for editorializing the release notes, Vladimír Čunát for his
   tireless effort in managing jobsets, staging cycles and build
   infrastructure, Cole Helbling for his epic effort in bisecting kernel
   issues with ARM64 for our remote builders, and Graham Christensen for
   dutifully tending to our build infrastructure.

  Reflections and Closing

   I am very thankful for this opportunity to learn about and participate in
   the release process. It has been an awesome experience to work with
   everyone on this release, and I want to say thank you to everyone in this
   community that built NixOS and helped made this release better.
