   Hey everyone, we are Weijia Wang and Jörg Thalheim, the release managers
   for this stable release and we are very proud to announce the public
   availability of NixOS 24.05 “Uakari”.

   NixOS is a Linux distribution, whose set of packages can also be used on
   other Linux systems and macOS.

   This release will receive bugfixes and security updates for seven months
   (up until 2024-12-31).

   The 24.05 release was made possible due to the efforts of 2491
   contributors, who authored 47795 commits since the previous release. Our
   thanks go the contributors who also take care of the continued stability
   and security of our stable release.

   NixOS is already known as the most up to date distribution while also
   being the distribution with the most packages. This release saw 17777 new
   packages and 16249 updated packages in Nixpkgs. We also removed 9393
   packages in an effort to keep the package set maintainable and secure. In
   addition to packages the NixOS distribution also features modules and
   tests that make it what it is. This release brought 145 new modules and
   removed 23. In that process we added 1983 options and removed 304.

   GNOME has been updated to version 46 “Kathmandu”, which introduces
   experimental VRR support, WebDAV support in Online Accounts, and more
   changes. Refer to the release notes for more details.

  Plasma 6

   Plasma has been updated to version 6.0, which introduces new defaults,
   refreshed Breeze, and more changes. Refer to the release notes for more
   details.

  Linux Kernel 6.6

   The default kernel package has been updated from 6.1 to 6.6. All supported
   kernels since 4.19 remain available.

   We want to personally thank Jacek Generowicz for editorializing the
   release notes, Lennart Mühlenmeier for doing the release logo, Vladimír
   Čunát for his tireless effort in managing jobsets and staging cycles,
