Nix Steering Committee Election 2024

   - Published on Mon Sep 16 2024

   As a first step towards a better governance for official Nix projects, we
   are happy to announce the kick-off of the first Nix Steering Committee
   election! The Steering Committee will be the primary community leadership
   body, responsible for steering the official Nix projects --
   organisationally, socially, and technically. This includes making
   decisions over what is official, managing teams, approving NixOS
   Foundation policies relevant for the community, being the final escalation
   point, and more as detailed in the Nix Governance Constitution. While the
   Steering Committee is given the authority to make decisions within the
   scope of its responsibilities directly,...

Open Letter to the European Commission

   - Published on Sun Jul 21 2024

   Initially published by petites singularités. English translation provided
   by OW2. If you want to sign the letter, please re-publish the original
   letter on your website and add to the list of signatories. Since 2020,
   Next Generation Internet (NGI) programmes, part of European Commission's
   Horizon programme, fund free software in Europe using a cascade funding
   mechanism (see for example NLnet's calls). This year, according to the
   Horizon Europe working draft detailing funding programmes for 2025, we
   notice that Next Generation Internet is not mentioned any more as part of
   Cluster 4. NGI programmes have shown their strength and importance to
   supporting the European software infrastructure, as a generic funding
   instrument to fund digital commons and ensure their long-term
   sustainability. We find this transformation incomprehensible, moreover
   when NGI has proven efficient and economical to support free software as a
   whole, from the smallest to the most established initiatives. This
   ecosystem diversity backs the strength of European technological
   innovation, and maintaining the NGI initiative to provide structural
   support to software projects at the heart of worldwide innovation is key
   to enforce the sovereignty of a European infrastructure. Contrary to
   common perception, technical innovations often originate from European
   rather than North American programming communities, and are mostly
   initiated by small-scaled organizations. Previous Cluster 4 allocated 27
   million euros to: &quot;Human centric Internet aligned with values and
   principles commonly shared in Europe&quot; ; &quot;A flourishing internet,
   based on common building blocks created within NGI, that enables better
   control of our digital life&quot; ;...

NixOS Community Survey 2022

   - Published on Tue Mar 01 2022

   The NixOS Marketing Team is pleased to announce the first offical NixOS
   Community Survey. Please take 5-10 minutes to complete it. Since the Nix
   community has been growing faster and larger every month, it's gotten
   harder to understand who makes up the community and what everyone cares
   about. So we're conducting this survey to improve our understanding of
   those questions. We hope to use your responses to develop Nix, NixOS, and
   Nixpkgs to match your needs and come up with new ideas for growing and
   serving the community. And we'll publish major findings on Discourse and
   nixos.org. All the questions are optional, and all responses are
   automatically anonymized. We will NOT collect your name, phone number,
   GitHub handle, IP address, or any other identifying information. The
   questions in the survey cover: Your background (e.g. What region of the
   world are you from?) The projects you use in the ecosystem (e.g. Are you
   using NixOS?) How you use the projects (e.g. Do you use Nix in production
   servers?)...

   from its own ashes, in the freshness of youth, to live through another
   cycle of years. So in a sense, it never truly dies, but regenerates itself

   Sander van der Burg and Eelco Dolstra) has been accepted for presentation
   at the 21st IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability
   Engineering (ISSRE 2010). It describes how system tests with complex
   requirements on the environment (such as remote machines, network
   topologies, system services or root privileges) can be written succinctly
   using declarative specifications of the machines needed by the test
   environment. From these specifications we can automatically instantiate
   (networks of) virtual machines. This is what we use for automated
   regression testing of NixOS itself. A draft of the paper is available. ...

Hydra

   - Published on Thu Feb 05 2009

   Nix and NixOS releases are now built in Hydra, the new Nix-based
   continuous build system. Hydra replaces our old Nix-based build farm,
   which will be phased out soon. There are several advantages over the old
   build farm: the build tasks for a project are scheduled and published
   separately, so that for instance a (fast) tarball build doesn’t have to
   wait for a (slow) Cygwin build; build results are stored in a database,
   which will enable all sorts of interesting queries; better error
   reporting; a better web interface; and much more. We have written a draft
   paper about Hydra. There are some instructions available about how to set
   up your own Hydra server. ...

   (it takes two hours to compile on an Intel Core 2 6700), OpenOffice had
   only two “impurities” (references to paths outside of the Nix store) in
   its build process that had to be resolved — a reference to /bin/bash and

   Wine now runs on NixOS! Finally we can run all those legacy

   of purely functional package composition, by the way: Wine didn’t work

New build farm hardware at TUD

   - Published on Fri Feb 23 2007

   To quote Eelco Visser: new hardware for buildfarm at Delft University of
   Technology has arrived. Here’s what we have: 5 Intel Core 2 Duo DualCore
   machines with 1GB RAM, 2 Mac minis with 1,83-GHz Intel Core Duo-processor,
   another Core 2 Duo a UPS to deal with spikes in power supply, a console
   with integrated monitor and keyboard switches, a rack with room for a
   couple more machines. Here’s what we’re going to do with the goodies. The
   five Intel machines and the two MacMinis (also Intel) are going to be used
   to crank at building hundreds of software packages. Using virtualisation
   we should be able to run builds on multiple operating system

Service deployment paper accepted for SCM-12

   - Published on Mon Aug 22 2005

   The paper “Service Configuration Management” (accepted at the 12th
   International Workshop on Software Configuration Management) describes how
   we can rather easily deploy “services” (e.g., complete webserver
   configurations such as our Subversion server) through Nix by treating the
   non-component parts (such as configuration files, control scripts and
   static data) as components that are built by Nix expressions. The result
   is that all advantages that Nix offers to software deployment also extend
   to service deployment, such as the ability to easily have multiple
   configuration side by side, to roll back configurations, and to identify
   the precise dependencies of a configuration. ...

   updates to Nix packages efficiently, even if “fundamental” packages like

   techniques such as patch chaining and computing deltas between archive
   files. ...
