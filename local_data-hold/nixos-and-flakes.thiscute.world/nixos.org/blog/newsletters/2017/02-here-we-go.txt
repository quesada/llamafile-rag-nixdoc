     * Feb 09, 2017, NixOS: Functional Packaging For The Win by Tobias Pflug
       at Wasserturm Stromeyersdorf, Konstanz, Germany

       Some of you might have heard about NixOS and its very different
       approach to a package and configuration management. While I am
       certainly not an expert with Nix myself I did tinker with it for a bit
       and I think it’s awesome. I would like to give you an idea of the
       concepts, possibilities and maybe spark some interest.

     * Feb 24—26, 2017, HackIllinois, University of Illinois, USA

       For any university students in the US, the University of Illinois at
       Urbana-Champaign is holding a hackathon oriented towards getting
       people into open source development, and I’m going to be mentoring
       people for Nix/NixOS/Haskell development. Be sure to put “NixOS” or
       “Haskell” into your application somewhere.

                                      Jobs

     * Smarkets, London, United Kingdom

       We are looking for Infra team lead and Infra engineer.

       The jobs are not a Nix jobs per se since we are not using Nix at the
       moment. However, internally few of us are interested in trying it for
       e.g. building AMIs or provisioning docker containers with (mostly)
       python software. We think some strong candidate with experience of
       using Nix in production would have a good chance of seeing some
       adoption here.

   Write us if you are looking for some Nix developers.

   Lately, I was thinking about the structure of this newsletter and noticed
   that it is quite advance Nix oriented. Would a section where we would
   promote questions from reddit / stack overflow be of any help to
   newcomers? Let me know.
