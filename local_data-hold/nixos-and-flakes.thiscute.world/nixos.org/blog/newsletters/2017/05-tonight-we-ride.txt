                             #05 - Tonight We Ride

   The 17.03 “Gorilla” release has been tagged! There are too many good
   things in this release to pick favourites. I refer you to the release
   notes instead.

   Some fun stats:

     * ~ 900 new packages since 16.09
     * ~ 80 new contributors (very inexact science this)
     * ~ 60 new services

                                      News

     * Did I mention the release? Robin has been doing a fantastic job, thank
       him when you meet him! He’s also had a lot of help of course, so
       thanks to all those people as well. It’s a pretty long list and you
       can get it with “git shortlog 8def08..17.03”.
     * Extra capacity is coming for Hydra OSX builds, thanks to all the great
       people that have donated to NixOS Foundation.
     * We now have an official RFC process. Thanks to zimbatm for writing our
       first ever RFC. We already have three pull requests so go forth and
       comment.
     * remove-perl branch just got merged to master. Time to celebrate.
     * Sander released Disnix 0.7
     * Théophane has started his work on typing Nix. You can follow along
       here. He’s also answering some questions in this mailing list thread.

                                    Reading

     * One long-standing issue in Nix has been the storage of secrets. Right
       now many of our services store their secrets in /nix where they are
       world readable. This means you can’t have root-only secrets,
       multi-user systems are problematic, and if one of your services is
       compromised it can be used to steal all your other secrets. Eelco
       created an RFC for encrypting secrets at rest.
     * Monte is a dynamic language inspired by Python and E. It uses Nix,
       under the hook, for its packaging. Worth checking out if you are
       writing a new languge and want to see how Nix help you.
     * A Gentle Introduction to the Nix Family by Rommel Martinez.

                                    Meetups

   A substantial part of the effort of publishing the “weekly” news is
   collecting the news in the first place. If you see anything cool, want to
   share a job, meetup or presentation add a comment with your item at
