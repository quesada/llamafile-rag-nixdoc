                 #07 - You have one hell of a Linux system here

                 #07 - You have one hell of a Linux system here

   A few months ago a proposal to define improvements process (nixos/rfcs)
   was announced.

   While many contributions to Nix and NixOS related projects fits into
   GitHub pull requests model, doing a substantial change requires more
   involvement from the community.

   Two months later we can see that NixOS community is picking up on the
   process and RFCs are starting to show up each week.

                                      News

     * First RFC to go through the process. What a milestone!

       RFC 0004: Replace Unicode Quotes was voted to be implemented.

       And there is a good list of interesting RFCs which are being
       discussed:

          * (draft) RFC 0003: SOS: Simple Override Strategy
          * (draft) RFC 0005: Nix encryption
          * (draft) RFC 0008: Readonly recursive Nix
          * (draft) RFC 0009: Nix rapid release
          * (draft) RFC 0010: Nixpkgs development support
          * (draft) RFC 0011: Per project config
          * (draft) RFC 0012: Declarative virtual machines
     * nix-index by Benno Fünfstück

       A tool to make the process of finding the packages and their files in
       nixpkgs easier.

     * styx, a static site generator in Nix expression language.

       To give it a quick try:

 $ nix-shell -p styx
 $ styx new site mysite && cd mysite

     * NixOS at Linux Infotag Augsburg

       Last week Linux Infotag Augsburg (“Linux Info Day”) happened at
       Hochschule Augsburg. Like last year and the year before, a NixOS booth
       was organized. A Short Retrospective by Profpatsch.

     * And in case you didn’t know …

       Nix package manager works flawlessly in Windows 10 Creators Update
       with Windows Subsystem for Linux

                                    Reading

     * My journey into Nix
     * My first Nix derivation
     * Reimplement “npm install -g” with nix and bash
     * Create a blog with styx

                                Events / Meetups

     * Thu, May 4, 2017, regular Meetup @c-base, Berlin, Germany

       Generally, the event is not structured, we have no talks or
       presentations planned. It’s up to the participants, what’s going to
       happen.
