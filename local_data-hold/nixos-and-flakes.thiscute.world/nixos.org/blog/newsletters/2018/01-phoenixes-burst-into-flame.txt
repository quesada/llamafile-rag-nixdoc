                     #01 - Phoenixes burst into flame \...

   The phoenix is a long-lived fiery bird that is present in many different
   mythologies from around the world. When a phoenix “dies”, it does so by
   combustion and is reborn of the ashes left behind. It rises from its own
   ashes, in the freshness of youth, to live through another cycle of years.
   So in a sense, it never truly dies, but regenerates itself and lives
   forever. Just like this weekly newsletter.

   Welcome to the 2018 NixOS “Weekly” newsletter.

   We are back and hope to produce more of them this year then we did last
   year. As always contributions are more then welcome. The more people help
   shape this newsletter the more accurate it will be.
