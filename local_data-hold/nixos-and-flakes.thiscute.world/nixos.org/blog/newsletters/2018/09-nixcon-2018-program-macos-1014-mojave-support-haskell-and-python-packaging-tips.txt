   #09 - NixCon 2018 program, macOS 10.14 Mojave support, Haskell and Python
                                 packaging tips

                                      News

     * The NixCon 2018 sold out and program is now live

     * Help make the Nix ecosystem’s docs better

       A lot of people meet DocBook for the first time when they’re
       contributing to the documentation of older, well established open
       source projects like NixOS. Now there is https://docbook.rocks/ to
       help you get past the initial hurdle of “what do I do now?” I hope
       this helps!

     * Nix 2.1 has been added to the docker images

     * Creating Nix build function abstractions for pluggable SDKs

     * Packaging a Haskell library for artefact evaluation using nix

     * A way to develop software with Nix

       This project illustrates using the Nix package manager for programming
       heterogeneous, multi-module projects. Notably, it provides a Nix
       library called Pkgs-make to save some of the boilerplate we might have
       to write when using Nix for managing a software lifecycle. Pkgs-make
       currently directly supports Haskell and Python development, but has
       the potential to support other language platforms.

     * Nix 2.1 is compatible with macOS 10.14 Mojave, make sure to update Nix
       before upgrading

     * travis-ci Nix support now allows setting Nix version

     * Building Customised NixOS Images
