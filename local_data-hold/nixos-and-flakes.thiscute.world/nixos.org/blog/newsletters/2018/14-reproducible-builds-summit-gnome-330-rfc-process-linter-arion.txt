     * Gnome 3.30 with wayland support has hit master

       To launch a wayland session simply use GDM or SDDM and select the
       gnome session. Select gnome-xorg to run an X11 session. If you
       encounter a bug please cc @hedning on github.

     * Fast Docker Compose ‘deployments’ for development with Arion

       A little tool we use at Hercules CI for process supervision of local
       developer environments. No need to export, load or garbage collect
       Docker images!

     * RFC0036 (Improving the RFC process) entered its Final Comments Period
       with a disposition of merge

       FCP will end on Dec. 20, so go and check no important point has been
       left undiscussed!

     * Hercules CI development update

       A short demo of CI development progress in the last couple of weeks
       including what have we worked on.

     * Nix-linter v0.2.0.0 released

       Nix-linter is a program to check for several common mistakes or
       stylistic errors in Nix expressions, such as unused arguments, empty
       let blocks, etcetera.
