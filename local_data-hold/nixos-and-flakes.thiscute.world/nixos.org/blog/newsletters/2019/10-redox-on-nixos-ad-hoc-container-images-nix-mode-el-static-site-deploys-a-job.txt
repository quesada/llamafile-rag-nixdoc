#10 - Redox on NixOS, ad-hoc container images, nix-mode.el, static site deploys,
                                     a job

                                      News

     * A set of patches to build Redox on NixOS

       An attempt to embrace Nix instead of constantly working around the
       limitations to build Redox OS. The ultra optimistic long-term goal is
       to be a competing alternative to the GNU make build system the project
       currently uses, to make Redox builds reproducible and reliable.

     * An experiment: ad-hoc container images

       made by @tazjin

     * Using NixOS as an stateless workstation

       EuAndreh goes through the journey of installing NixOS on their laptop.

     * nix-mode.el 1.4.1 release

       Added support for the indentation function smie-indent-line in
       NixOS/nix-mode#79 & NixOS/nix-mode#80. Thanks to @j-piecuch and
       @matthewbauer for the work and testing.

     * PDT Partners is looking for an experienced engineer

       For our Software Infrastructure team, which is responsible for our
       build, packaging, CI and deployment tooling. We’re using Nix to
       package our complex C++ and Python stack, and as part of our wider
       development environment for our fast-moving trading and research
       applications.

     * Complete overkill or exactly right? Deploying a static site using nix

     * Introducing nixpkgs-tungsten: The most convenient way to working with
       Tungsten Fabric

       Tungsten Fabric is the open-source offering of Contrail by Juniper
       Networks - a powerful SDN solution used by many big names in the IT
       industry. The nixpkgs-tungsten project provides tools and workflows
       that make it much easier to work with, and on Tungsten Fabric itself.
