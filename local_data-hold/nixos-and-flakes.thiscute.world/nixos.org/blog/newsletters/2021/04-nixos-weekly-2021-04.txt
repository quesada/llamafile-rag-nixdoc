     * NixNG, a late sibling distribution to NixOS, without systemd!

       NixNG is a proof-of-concept distribution which works very similarly to
       NixOS, but aims to run well in containers and also smells more
       BSD-esque. Currently, it uses runit instead of systemd, but we‚Äôre open
       to multi-init support and also to our own init system.

       deployment specifications of running processes, that can be managed
       with a variety of process managers (e.g. systemd, supervisord,
       launchd, s6-rc). Furthermore, you can construct multiple instances of
       the same processes and deploy them as an unprivileged user. The
       testing framework allows you to validate a service under all these
       conditions.
