                                    Preface

   This is a ported version of the Nix Pills, a series of blog posts written
   by Luca Bruno (aka Lethalman) and originally published in 2014 and 2015.
   It provides a tutorial introduction into the Nix package manager and
   Nixpkgs package collection, in the form of short chapters called 'pills'.

   Since the Nix Pills are considered a classic introduction to Nix, an
   effort to port them to the current format was led by Graham Christensen
   (aka grahamc / gchristensen) and other contributors in 2017.

   For an up-to-date version, please visit

   If you encounter problems, please report them on the nixos/nix-pills issue
   tracker.
