The Pain of NixOS Beginners - Documentation and Flakes ​

   NixOS is a highly distinctive Linux distribution built upon the Nix
   package manager, with a design philosophy that sets it apart from
   traditional distributions like Ubuntu, CentOS, Arch Linux and others.

   One of NixOS's major advantages over other distributions lies in its
   reproducibility and declarative configuration, allowing users to replicate
   consistent system environments across multiple machines.

   While NixOS is powerful, its strength also comes with increased system
   complexity. This makes it more challenging for newcomers. One major
   challenge is that the knowledge accumulated on other Linux distributions
   is not easily transferable to NixOS. Another is that official and
   community documentation is often scattered and outdated. These issues have
   troubled many NixOS beginners.

   One can observe these issues with the experimental feature of the Nix
   package manager called Flakes. Inspired by package managers like npm and
   Cargo, Flakes uses flake.nix to record all external dependencies and
   flake.lock to lock their versions. This significantly enhances the
   reproducibility and composability of the Nix package manager and NixOS
   configurations.

   Flakes' advantages have made it widely popular within the community:
   according to official surveys, over half of the new Nix repositories
   created on GitHub now utilize Flakes.

   However, to maintain stability, the official documentation covers barely
   any Flakes-related content. This has left many Nix/NixOS users feeling
   confused. They see everyone using Flakes and want to learn it too, but
   find nowhere to start, often having to piece together scattered
   information, search through Nixpkgs source code, or seek help from more
   experienced users.

The Origin of This Book ​

   This book originated from my scattered notes when I first started with
   NixOS.

   In April of this year (2023), when I got into NixOS, I fell in love with
   its design philosophy. At the recommendation of a friend, I learned about
   Nix's Flakes experimental feature. After comparing Flakes with the
   traditional NixOS configuration method, I realized that only a
   Flakes-enabled NixOS met my expectations. Consequently, I completely
   ignored the traditional Nix configuration approach and directly learned to
   configure my NixOS system using Flakes during my initial steps.

   Throughout my learning process, I found that there were very few
   beginner-friendly Flakes resources. The vast majority of documentation
   focused on the traditional Nix configuration approach, forcing me to
   extract the information I needed from various sources such as the NixOS
   Wiki, Zero to Nix, Nixpkgs Manual, and Nixpkgs source code while
   disregarding any non-Flakes-related content. This learning journey was
   quite convoluted and painful. To prevent future stumbling, I diligently
   documented numerous scattered notes as I progressed.

   With some experience under my belt, in early May of this year, I switched
   my main PC to NixOS. After organizing and refining my NixOS newcomer
   notes, I published them on my blog^[1] and shared them in the NixOS
   Chinese community. The Chinese community responded positively, and based
   on their advice, I translated the article into English and shared it on
   Reddit, receiving strong feedback^[2].

   The positive reception of this shared document encouraged me and drove me
   to continue improving it. Through continuous updates, the content of this
   document expanded to over 20,000 words. Some readers suggested that the
   reading experience could be improved, leading me to their suggestions^[3].
   As a result, I migrated the article's content to a GitHub repository,
   established a dedicated documentation site, and adjusted the presentation
   to make it more aligned with a beginner's guide rather than a personal
   notebook.

   And so, a bilingual open-source book was born, which I named "<NixOS &
   Flakes Book>" with the Chinese title "NixOS & Flakes 新手指南" ("NixOS &
   Flakes Beginner's Guide").

   This open-source book's content evolved step by step as I used NixOS and
   engaged with readers. The sense of accomplishment from readers' positive
   feedback has been my greatest motivation for updates. Some readers'
   feedback has been immensely helpful in its "evolution." Initially, I only
   wanted to share my experiences with NixOS in a somewhat casual manner, but
   it unexpectedly turned into an open-source book. Its readership abroad
   even surpassed that within my own country, and it garnered many stars - a
   result I never anticipated.

   I am grateful to all friends who have contributed to this book and offered
   suggestions, and I appreciate all the support and encouragement from the
   readers. Without all of you, this book's content might have remained
   confined to my personal blog, and it wouldn't have reached its current
   form.

The Features of This Book ​

    1. Focused on NixOS and Flakes, disregarding the traditional Nix
       configuration approach.
    2. Beginner-friendly, with explanations from the perspective of NixOS
       newcomers who have some experience with Linux usage and programming.
    3. Step-by-step, progressive learning.
    4. Most of the chapters in this book provide reference links at the end,
       making it easy for readers to delve deeper into the topics and
       evaluate the content's credibility.
    5. Coherent content, well-organized, and structured. Readers can either
       read the book gradually or quickly find the information they need.

Feedback and Discussion ​

   I’m not an expert on NixOS, and I’ve only been using NixOS for less than 9
   months until now(2024-02), so there must be some misconceptions or complex
   cases in the book. If anyone finds anything incorrect or have any
   questions / suggestions, just let me know about it by opening an issue or
   joining the discussion on GitHub Discussions. I'm happy to continue
   improving the content of this book.

   The reason why I wrote this little book was only because no one in the
   community did it for me, who was a beginner at the time, so I chose to do
   it myself. Even though I knew I could make mistakes, it's much better than
   doing nothing.

   My hope is that this book can help more people, enabling them to
   experience the joys of NixOS. Hope you like it!
