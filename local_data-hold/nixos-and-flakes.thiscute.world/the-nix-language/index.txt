                          Basics of the Nix Language ​

   The Nix language is essential for declaring configurations to be built by
   Nix. To fully enjoy the benefits of NixOS and Flakes, it is necessary to
   grasp the fundamentals of this language.

   The Nix language is a straightforward functional language. If you have
   some programming experience, it should take you less than 2 hours to grasp
   its basics.

   The community already has a lot of good Nix language tutorials, so I won't
   reinvent the wheel. To get started, I recommend reading the following
   resources for a quick introduction to the Nix language:

    1. Nix Language Basics - nix.dev: This tutorial provides a comprehensive
       overview of the basics of the Nix language, recommended for beginners.
    2. A tour of Nix: An online interactive tutorial focuses on programming
       language constructs and how Nix can be algorithmically used to solve
       problems.
    3. Nix Language - Nix Reference Manual: The official documentation of the
       Nix language.
         1. nix.dev and other user-friendly tutorials are suitable for
            starter reading only, and neither of them fully introduces the
            full syntax of Nix. If you encounter a new syntax that you have
            not come across before, please refer to this official document.
    4. https://noogle.dev/ is a Nix function library search engine that can
       help you quickly find the functions you need and their usage, which is
       very practical.

   It's okay to have a rough impression of the syntax for now. You can come
   back to review the syntax when you find something you don't understand
   later.
