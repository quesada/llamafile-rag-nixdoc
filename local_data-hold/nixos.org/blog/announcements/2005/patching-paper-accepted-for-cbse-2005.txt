                     Patching paper accepted for CBSE 2005

   The paper “Efficient Upgrading in a Purely Functional Component Deployment
   Model” has been accepted at CBSE 2005. It describes how we can deploy
   updates to Nix packages efficiently, even if “fundamental” packages like
   Glibc are updated (which cause a rebuild of all dependent packages), by
   deploying binary patches between components in the Nix store. Includes
   techniques such as patch chaining and computing deltas between archive
   files.
