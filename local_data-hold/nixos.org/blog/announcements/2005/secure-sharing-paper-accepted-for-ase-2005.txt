                   Secure sharing paper accepted for ASE 2005

   The paper “Secure Sharing Between Untrusted Users in a Transparent
   Source/Binary Deployment Model” has been accepted at ASE 2005. This paper
   describes how a Nix store can be securely shared by multiple users who may
   not trust each other; i.e., how do we prevent one user from installing a
   Trojan horse that is subsequently executed by some other user?
