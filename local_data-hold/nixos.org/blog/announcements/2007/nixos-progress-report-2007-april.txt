                             NixOS progress report

   NixOS screenshot NixOS is now almost usable as a desktop OS ;-). We have
   an X server, a bunch of Gnome packages, basic wireless support, and of
   course all the applications in Nixpkgs that we had all along running on
   other Linux distributions. Here are a few screenshots:

     * X server with Compiz window manager.
     * Emacs and a few terminals showing off the (near) absence of /lib, /bin
       etc.; everything is in the Nix store.
     * Some applications.
