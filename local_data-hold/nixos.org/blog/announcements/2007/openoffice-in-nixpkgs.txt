                             OpenOffice in Nixpkgs

   Published on Wed Oct 10 2007

                             OpenOffice in Nixpkgs

   OpenOffice screenshot OpenOffice is now in Nixpkgs (screenshot of
   OpenOffice 2.2.1 running under NixOS, and another screenshot). Despite
   being a rather gigantic package (it takes two hours to compile on an Intel
   Core 2 6700), OpenOffice had only two “impurities” (references to paths
   outside of the Nix store) in its build process that had to be resolved — a
   reference to /bin/bash and one to /usr/lib/libjpeg.so.

   Armijn Hemel, Wouter den Breejen and Eelco Dolstra contributed to the Nix
   expression for OpenOffice.
