                         NixOS paper accepted at ICFP!

   The paper “NixOS: A Purely Functional Linux Distribution” (by Eelco
   Dolstra and Andres Löh) has been accepted for presentation at the 2008
   International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP). It describes
   NixOS in much greater detail than last year’s HotOS paper, and argues why
   the purely functional style and features such as laziness are important
   for system configuration management. It also provides some measurements on
   the actual purity of Nix build actions. A draft of the paper is available.
