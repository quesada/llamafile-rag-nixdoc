                      Heartbleed vulnerability in OpenSSL

   Published on Fri May 09 2014

                      Heartbleed vulnerability in OpenSSL

   A serious security vulnerability has been discovered in OpenSSL. All
   stable NixOS releases prior to version 13.10.35708.15a465c are vulnerable.
   (You can see your current version by running nixos-version.) To upgrade to
   the latest NixOS version, run nixos-rebuild switch —upgrade. You can
   verify whether you are safe by running

   $ nix-store -qR /run/current-system | grep openssl

   If this shows any OpenSSL version prior to 1.0.1g, you may be vulnerable.
