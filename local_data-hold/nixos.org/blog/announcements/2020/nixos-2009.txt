   Hey everyone, I’m Jonathan Ringer, one of the release managers for 20.09.
   As promised, the latest stable release is here: NixOS 20.09 “Nightingale”
   ✨.

   The 20.09 release was possible due to the efforts of 1313 contributors in
   31282 commits. We would especially like to thank our top 10 contributors:
   Mario Rodas, Frederik Rietdijk, Jörg Thalheim, Maximilian Bosch, Jonathan
   Ringer, Jan Tojnar, Daniël de Kok, WORLDofPEACE, Florian Klink, José
   Romildo Malaquias, and 1303 others!

   NixOS is already known as the most up to date distribution and is in the
   top three by total number of packages.

   This didn’t stop us. In the last six months:

     * 7349 packages were added
     * 8181 packages were removed
     * 14442 packages were updated

   Likewise, our NixOS module system got bigger and better:

     * 1119 options were added (61 new modules)
     * 476 options removed
     * 118 options were updated

  Stabilization Contributors

   Stabilization of the NixOS happens a month before planned release. The
   goal is to have as little as possible continuous integration (Hydra) jobs
   failing before the release is cut. While we would like to release on time,
   a high quality release is more important.

   Individuals who contributed to stabilizing this release: volth, Robert
   Scott, Tim Steinbach, WORLDofPEACE, Maximilian Bosch, Thomas Tuegel, Doron
   Behar, Vladimír Čunát, Jonathan Ringer, Maciej Krüger, and 190 others!

  Reflections and Closing

   I think that the 20.09 release highlighted a few weak points with our
   current release schedule. Discussions have already began on how to improve
   the process from the beginning, to help minimize risk, and set ourselves
   up for more successes in the future. I want to thank WORLDofPEACE (my
   co-release-manager) for helping me with release management items, Thomas
   Tuegel for helping with Qt and Plasma stabilization, as well as Robert
   Scott for his work with release stabilization.
