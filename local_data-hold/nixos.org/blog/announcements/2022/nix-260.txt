                               Nix 2.6.0 released

   Published on Wed Jan 26 2022

                               Nix 2.6.0 released

   We’re pleased to announce the availability of Nix 2.6.0.

   Instructions how to install Nix on different platforms can be found on the
   download page.

   Here are the release notes:

     * New builtin function builtins.zipAttrsWith with the same functionality
       as lib.zipAttrsWith from Nixpkgs, but much more efficient.
     * The Nix CLI now searches for a flake.nix up until the root of the
       current Git repository or a filesystem boundary rather than just in
       the current directory.
     * The TOML parser used by builtins.fromTOML has been replaced by a more
       compliant one.
     * Added :st/:show-trace commands to nix repl, which are used to set or
       toggle display of error traces.
     * New command nix store copy-log to copy build logs from one store to
       another.
     * The commit-lockfile-summary option can be set to a non-empty string to
       override the commit summary used when commiting an updated lockfile.
       This may be used in conjunction with the nixConfig attribute in
       flake.nix to better conform to repository conventions.
     * docker run -ti nixos/nix:master will place you in the Docker container
       with the latest version of Nix from the master branch.

   The next release is scheduled for 2022-03-07.
