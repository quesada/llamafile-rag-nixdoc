                      Nix Steering Committee Election 2024

   Published on Mon Sep 16 2024

                      Nix Steering Committee Election 2024

   As a first step towards a better governance for official Nix projects, we
   are happy to announce the kick-off of the first Nix Steering Committee
   election!

   The Steering Committee will be the primary community leadership body,
   responsible for steering the official Nix projects — organisationally,
   socially, and technically. This includes making decisions over what is
   official, managing teams, approving NixOS Foundation policies relevant for
   the community, being the final escalation point, and more as detailed in
   the Nix Governance Constitution.

   While the Steering Committee is given the authority to make decisions
   within the scope of its responsibilities directly, it is expected to
   delegate as much as possible.

   Note that you can also read and publicly discuss this announcement on
   Discourse.

Participating

   Automatically eligible voters will be sent an email and be added/invited
   to the @NixOS/voters-2024 GitHub team. If you’re on the GitHub team but
   have not received an email, make sure to check and optionally update your
   email address.

   If you’re neither on the GitHub team nor have received an email, you’re
   likely not automatically eligible. In this case you may consider
   requesting an exception.

   Members of the GitHub team can:

     * Nominate themselves or others.
     * Endorse unconfirmed nominees that they’d like to be able to vote for.
     * Ask questions to nominees as the primary way of engaging with them.

   If you have any questions or need support, please get in touch with the
   Election Committee.
