                          #03 - Better Late Than Never

   Published on Wed Feb 22 2017

                          #03 - Better Late Than Never

   Another two weeks have passed and it is time for our summary.

   A new section Questions was added to the newsletter. The intention for
   this new section is that it is going to expose some of the questions that
   happen in the past. We hope that none of the questions will be left
   unanswered.

   Sometimes we forget just how awesome Nix / NixOS is and we take its
   capabilities for granted. It is important that we remind ourself from time
   to time why are we using it, via reddit - In Love:

     Just thought I’d share a compliment, switched from Arch, this thing is
     beautiful. Installing low level packages, configuration files, it all
     works so well.

     Only issues are documentation (which I can see is being worked on and
     solved, albeit with limited manpower), and that some packages don’t seem
     to work well with the package manager, but that’s fixable over time.

     But it’s great for what it is, easy to get running, but still fully
     customization.

                                      News

     * Important date: 27. Feb 2017 a branch-off for next NixOS release,
       17.03 (Gorilla), is going to happen

       This means you have few more days to land your change to nixpkgs
       master if you want them to be a part of Gorilla.

       You can also follow the 17.03 milestone.

     * Assistance Required for Vulnerability Roundups

       Since last newsletter 2 Vulnerability Roundup happen: 21, 22.

       Graham Christensen is doing an amazing work coordinating the effort of
       a security team and also doing a big chunk of the work. Recently he
       asked for help and let us make sure he gets some helping hand, or two,
       three, …

       We can all recognize that The work the security team is doing is of a
       great importance, since that makes it possible for the rest community
       to use NixOS in more production environments.

     * At FOSDEM a very [spontaneous NixOS discussion panel
       happen]{.title-ref}. As a follow-up @zimbatm created an initial
       proposal for RFC.

       Having a more formal proposal how we work together and how bigger
       changes are discussed is a step towards mature Linux distribution.
       Having NixOS already reached this state is an impressive achievement.

     * xorg-server major update

     * KDE4 removed in master

     * Haskell: master has switched to LTS 8.x with GHC 8.0.2

     * Python 3 as default (discussion).

     * Nixpkgs: Adding setcap-wrapper functionality

     * Nix: Add support for s3:// URIs

     * Feedback requested: Feedback on workshop material

     * Feedback requested: Better firewalling in NixOS

     * Feedback requested: “Monitoring” NixOS?

     * Release: vagrant-nixos-plugin released v0.2.1, now with —show-trace
       support.

       Add basic nix configuration provisioning for NixOS guests in Vagrant.

     * Release: docker-nix-builder beta.

       Did you ever have to battle with a user that only wants to have Docker
       installed on his system? Or a user that is developing on macOS and has
       broken nix packages?

       docker-nix-builder is a tool to help smooth the transition. Instead of
       using nix to build the project, use Docker to run nix to build the
       project. At the end the users gets a new Docker container that only
       (mostly) contains the build result.

     * Release: Bundle Nix derivations to run anywhere, nix-bundle

       nix-bundle is a way to package Nix attributes into single-file
       executables. Benefits: Single-file output, Can be run by non-root
       users, No runtime, Distro agnostic, Completely portable, No
       installation

       For any university students in the US, the University of Illinois at

       people into open source development, and I’m going to be mentoring
       people for Nix/NixOS/Haskell development. Be sure to put “NixOS” or
       “Haskell” into your application somewhere.

       as nix/NixOS.

                                      Jobs

     Looking for some Nix developers? Let us help you.

     * Smarkets, London, United Kingdom

       We are looking for Infra team lead and Infra engineer.

       The jobs are not a Nix jobs per se since we are not using Nix at the
       moment. However, internally few of us are interested in trying it for
       e.g. building AMIs or provisioning docker containers with (mostly)
       python software. We think some strong candidate with experience of
       using Nix in production would have a good chance of seeing some
       adoption here.
