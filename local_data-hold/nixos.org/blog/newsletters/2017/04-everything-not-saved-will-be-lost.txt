                    #04 - Everything not saved will be lost

   Published on Mon Mar 13 2017

                    #04 - Everything not saved will be lost

   Nix, NixOS and nixpkgs are all moving ahead at good speed. The 17.03
   milestone is more than 50% complete, and we merged 144 pull requests for
   nixpkgs just in the last seven days.

                                      News

     * The NixOS 17.03 beta has been announced.
     * We now allow packages to be marked insecure, and you have to opt-in to
       install insecure packages similarly to how you opt in to non-free
       software. The option is called permittedInsecurePackages. See the
       updated docs for more.
     * Robin finished the systemd 232 update which opens up several new
       opportunities for hardening. It will also allow us to move away from
       hard-coded user IDs for less important services. Just use DynamicUser
       = true.
     * Thanks to Graham we now have aarch64 support, and it’s even being
       built by Hydra! Many of you will have noticed already from the
       beautiful stream of emails for each succeeding and failing package.
     * Progress on the proposal for RFC which started from a FOSDEM
       discussion.
     * Move NodeJS to separate overlay repository? (discussion)

                                    Reading

     * From Vagrant to NixOps by Hendrik Schaeidt

       A walkthrough to configure a symfony2 project with nginx, mysql, and
       php-fpm from scratch.

                                 Presentations

     * Eric Sagnes gave an introductory NixOS talk in Japanese. The slides
       are here.
     * Maksim Bronsky presented Vulnix at Chemnitzer Linux-Tage. The slides
       (PDF download, DE only) are in the repository.
     * Lenko Donchev gave a lightning talk “NixOS the purely functional Linux
       distribution”. The slides are available online.
     * John Wiegley gave a presentation “How I use nix for Haskell
       development” at the Bay Area Nix/NixOS User Group. Video available.

                                    Meetups

     * Mar 24, 2017, Tokyo NixOS Meetup, Tokyo, Japan

       My Japanese isn’t good enough to figure out the speaker, but if you
       live in Japan you should go!

     * Mar 29, 2017, Munich NixOS Meetup at OpenLab Augsburg, Augsburg,
       Germany

       John Darrington will give a talk about guix and guixSD, a package
       manager and a Linux distribution which are based on similar concepts
       as nix/NixOS.

       The talk will be in English.

Meetups that just happened

     * Feb 24—26, 2017, HackIllinois, University of Illinois, USA

       For any university students in the US, the University of Illinois at
       Urbana-Champaign is holding a hackathon oriented towards getting
       people into open source development, and I’m going to be mentoring
       people for Nix/NixOS/Haskell development. Be sure to put “NixOS” or
       “Haskell” into your application somewhere.

     * Feb 25, 2017, Amsterdam Nix Meetup at Container Solutions, Amsterdam,
       Netherlands

     * Mar 02, 2017, Bay Area Nix/NixOS User Group at Takt, San Francisco,

       Smarkets kindly offered us a space for our second community hackday!

       There will be talking, pizzas and lots of packaging going on. Bring
       your own projects or just tag along and help other people out. Whether
       you have some software that you’d like to see packaged or questions
       about how everything fits together, there will be people available to
       help you.

                                   Questions

     * In a new nixos derivation, based on a binary distribution, why am I
       getting an error referring to nativeBuildInputs?
     * NixOS container networking.
     * LXC containers on NixOS.
     * Virtualization on NixOS.

                                      Jobs

   First time run for me to take care as the editor for an edition of [NixOS
   Weekly]{.title-ref}. It has been fantastic to see a few people
   spontaneously helping out to make it happen after a call for help from
   Rok.
