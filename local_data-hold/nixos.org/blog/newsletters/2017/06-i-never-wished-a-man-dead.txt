                        #06 - I never wished a man dead

                        #06 - I never wished a man dead

   Or in other words: no more Perl in Nix! Shea Levy’s last branch for his
   long-ongoing work to remove Perl from the Nix tool has finally been merged

                                      News

     * NixOS on Packet.net

       Over the past several months, Graham Christensen (grahamc), Tuomas
       Tynkkynen (dezgeg), and many wonderful people from Packet.net have
       collaborated on bringing NixOS to Packet.net.

       Our collaboratioon started in January with Packet sponsoring many
       Hydra build servers. It continued by bringing ARMv8 builders to
       hydra.nixos.org. It is continued again today by launching first-class
       support for NixOS on the Packet.net platform, directly from their
       panel.

         …launching first-class support for NixOS…

       This allows any user to quickly provision four different types of
       powerful, bare metal x86-64 servers in minutes.

     * NixOS Security Advisory: Docker Local Privilege Escalation

       This is a fun one because it is the first CVE taken against NixOS. A
       milestone!

       At this point we also must thank @grahamc and the security team for
       their heroic efforts. Their work makes NixOS a more reliable solution.

       To help them please head to Vulnerability Roundup 26.
