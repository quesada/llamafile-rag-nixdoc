            #02 - Life before death, strength before weakness, \...

   Welcome to another edition of NixOS “Weekly” News — we’re still working on
   that weekly bit and I’ve half a mind to amend the quote to add “monthly
   before weekly”.

   Let me start by addressing everyone who helped put this edition together:
   By creating the content and helping collect items, you make the newsletter
   possible. Thank you.

   Contributions for future editions are more than welcome. One way to help
   is by editing a release; we’ve added an Editor’s Guide to help you.

   There are some exciting things happening in the community, and I hope
   you’ll agree.
