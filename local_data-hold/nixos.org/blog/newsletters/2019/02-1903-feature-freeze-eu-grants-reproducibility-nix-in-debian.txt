     * Mapping a universe of open source software

       The repositories of distributions such as Debian and Nixpkgs are among
       the largest collections of open source (and some unfree) software.
       They are complex systems that connect and organize many interdependent
       packages. In this blog post we try to shed some light on them from the
       perspective of Nixpkgs, mostly with visualizations of its complete
       dependency.
