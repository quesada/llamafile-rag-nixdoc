 #11 - Nixery, nixfmt and Cachix releases, NixCon 2019 tickets, a job and first
                                impressions post

                                      News

     * nix is now easier to bootstrap on Linux distributions without previous
       nix installation.

       Non-NixOS users are encouraged to try and report whether the improved
       autoconf checks make it easier to build it from source.

     * static-haskell-nix started a crowd-funding on OpenCollective during
       ZuriHac to get its own dedicated Hetzner build server. Amazingly, the
       funding goal was reached within only 4 days!

     * A big rework of the gstreamer package landed in nixpkgs with the
       upgrade to 1.16.

       It also demonstrates how meson-build-system-based projects can be
       configured to complain loudly about any missing dependencies, as
       opposed to silently disabling features (like many autoconf based build
       systems do).

     * Cachix 0.2.1 released

       Upgrade via the usual: $ nix-env -iA cachix -f
       https://cachix.org/api/v1/install

       Notable improvement is the default compression level which has been
       lowered to increase bandwidth throughput and it’s overridable via
       --compression-level.

     * [Hercules CI #5 update requiredSystemFeatures, Cachix and Darwin
       support](https://blog.hercules-ci.com/sprints,/hercules-ci/2019/07/09/development-update-5-cachix-da
       rwin/)

       Preview access for the CI has been given to all subscribers as we’ve
       reached feature parity for the public launch.
