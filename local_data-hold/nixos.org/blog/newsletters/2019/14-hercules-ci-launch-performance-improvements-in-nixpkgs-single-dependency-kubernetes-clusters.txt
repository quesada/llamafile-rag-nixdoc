#14 - Hercules CI launch, performance improvements in nixpkgs, single dependency
                              kubernetes clusters

                                      News

     * Launching Hercules CI

       Announcing general availability of continuous integration specialized
       for Nix projects.

     * Hercules CI Agent 0.6.1

       Performance improvements, a bugfix to IFD and better onboarding
       experience.

     * Improved performance in Nixpkgs

       Improving Nixpkgs setup by avoiding subshells in processing
       dependencies.

     * Recently rewritten Nix-on-Droid got accepted into F-Droid repository

       Trying out Nix on your aarch64 or i686 Android device is now easier
       than ever.

     * Two big stdenv cleanups: Enable __structuredAttrs and treewide: set -u
       everywhere

       It’s time to clean up stdenv! By making our code less fragile, we
       increase the budget for interesting features. There should be plenty
       of failures, but many of them independent so we can easily parallelize
       the work to fix. Please come pitch in!

     * Pinning NixOps builds

     * Single dependency Kubernetes clusters for local testing, experimenting
       and development

     * RFC steering commitee nominations
