                               #03 - NixOS Weekly

                                      News

     * Introducing nixbuild.net

       nixbuild.net is nix build as a service, allowing you to easily run
       distributed builds without having to setup, scale and maintain build
       servers.

     * Proposal for improving Nix error messages

       Crowdfunding campaign to fund a complete rework of error messages in
       Nix to improve beginner’s experience and make working with the tooling
       pleasant.

     * Contextflow is hiring!

       contextflow is an award winning Vienna-based startup using AI on 3D
       medical images to improve radiology workflows. We are looking for a
       fulltime Senior DevOps and Backend Engineer (m/f) with NixOs
       experience.

     * nix-freeze-tree

       nix-freeze-tree is a utility that walks a directory tree, and writes
       out Nix expressions which rebuild that tree. The generated expressions
       have two important properties: a) Each file in the tree is built by a
       separate fixed-output derivation, and b) Directories are built by
       derivations that symlink their contents recursively. If you are using
       nix copy to ship a derivation between nix stores, copying the
       derivation built by evaluating the output of nix-freeze-tree can reuse
       existing files in the destination store, as fixed-output derivations
       can be checked against a hash before copying.

     * I was wrong about Nix

       Christine talks about packaging Go and Elm application with Nix and
       publishing binaries to Cachix.

     * How I start: Nix

       Christine talks about packaging and developing Rust with Nix.

     * Nixpkgs reached 200,000 commits milestone

       It took less than 3 years since previous 100,000 milestone

     * Nix for Coq Development

       Yann talks about how to package Coq with Nix using a simple tutorial.

     * Possible nixpkgs-based Google Summer of Code projects .

       We want to try to use nix(pkgs) to build perfectly reproducible
       environments in a context where the users wouldn’t even be aware that
       nix is a thing that exists (unless, obviously, they want to know).
       This is in the context of a bioinformatics application, written in
       Haskell, but the nixpkgs integration can be done without writing
       Haskell code (NGLess)

     * Nix: override packages with overlays

       Thomas has written a tutorial covering the problem that overlays are
       trying to solve, as well as how to use them.

     * Announcing TUNA Nix mirror for China users

     * Oslo NixOS minicon rapport

     * How NixOS Is Enabling Edge and IoT Projects

     * Interactive tutorials for using Nix and Nixpkgs written as a Jupyter
       notebook

       made by @FRidh

     * A declarative process manager-agnostic deployment framework based on
       Nix tooling
