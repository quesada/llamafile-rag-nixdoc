Announcements

     * Nix error messages proposal: phase 2, PR 1 merged!

       Nearly every C++ file in the repo was touched! This will be the
       biggest PR, by far, for this project. Getting this in is a major feat!

       Next up, I’m looking forward to finishing out this phase with showing
       the lines of code for errors, and supporting show-trace in the new
       format. I expect that PR to be much easier, both to make the changes
       and to review them.
