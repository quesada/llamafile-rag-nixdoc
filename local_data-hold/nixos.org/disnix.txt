                                     Disnix

   Disnix is a distributed service deployment extension for the Nix package
   manager.

   Nix builds packages from Nix expressions and manages intra-dependencies on
   single systems. Disnix extends the Nix approach to distributed
   service-oriented systems by managing inter-dependencies of a distributed
   system and performs the distribution and activation of distributed system
   components.

   It uses Nix expressions that capture the services, the infrastructure and
   the distribution of services to machines to automate the entire deployment
   process.

                                 Prerequisites

   In order to build Disnix from source code, the following packages are
   required:

     * libxml2
     * libxslt
     * glib

   When building directly from a Git clone, you also need:

     * help2man
     * doclifter

   To be able to build software with Disnix, Nix and Nixpkgs are required:

     * Nix
     * Nixpkgs

   To run the Disnix service you need the following packages:

     * Dysnomia, for activation and deactivation of services
     * OpenSSH, for using the disnix-ssh-client

   These dependencies can be acquired with the Nix package manager, your host
   system's package manager or be compiled from sources. Consult the
   documentation of your distribution or the corresponding packages for more
   information.

                                  Installation

   Disnix is a typical autotools based package which can be compiled and
   installed by running the following commands in a shell session:

 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ make install

   When building from the Git repository, you should run the bootstrap script
   first:

 $ ./bootstrap

   For more information about using the autotools setup or for customizing
   the configuration, take a look at the ./INSTALL file.

   Disnix must be installed on a coordinator machine that initiates
   deployment as well as all target machines in the network to which service
   components can be deployed.

   On the target machines, you must also run the disnix-service to make
   deployment operations remotely accessible. The Disnix service requires a
   protocol wrapper to actually do this. The default wrapper in the Disnix
   distribution is the SSH wrapper. More information on this can be found in
   the Disnix manual.

   Moreover, it also requires Dysnomia to be installed so that services can
   activated and deactivated.

   The coordinator machine requires the presence of a copy of Nixpkgs to make
   building of service components possible. In order to find the location of
   Nixpkgs, the NIX_PATH environment variable must be refer to the location
   where Nixpkgs is stored. This can be done by running the following
   command-line instruction:

 $ export NIX_PATH="nixpkgs=/path/to/nixpkgs"

   On NixOS, this environment variable has already been configured.

                                     Usage

   In order to deploy a service-oriented system, a developer has to write Nix
   expressions that capture the services of which a distributed system
   consists, the infrastructure that descibes the machines in a network
   (including their properties) and a distribution of service components to
   machines in the network.

   By invoking disnix-env with these Nix expressions as parameters, services
   are automatically built from source code (including all its
   intra-dependencies), distributed to the target machines and activated in
   the right order. In case of a failure a rollback is performed:

 $ disnix-env -s services.nix -i infrastructure.nix -d distribution.nix

   See the tutorials on the webpage for more information on deploying a
   service-oriented system with Disnix.

   Disnix itself has a modular architecture, which supports various
   extensions that can be used to make integration with the host environment
   better and deployment activities more convenient. Refer to the Disnix
   manual to see what extensions can be used.

                                     Manual

   Disnix has a nice Docbook manual that can be compiled yourself. However,
   it is also available online.
