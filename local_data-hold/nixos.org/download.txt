                           Nix : the package manager

Current version

   2.24.9

  Linux

  Multi-user installation (recommended)

   Install Nix via the recommended multi-user installation:

 $ sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon

   We recommend the multi-user install if you are on Linux running systemd,
   with SELinux disabled and you can authenticate with sudo.

  Single-user installation

   Install Nix via the single-user installation:

 $ sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --no-daemon

   Above command will perform a single-user installation of Nix, meaning that
   nix is owned by the invoking user. You should run this under your usual
   user account, not as root. The script will invoke sudo to create /nix if
   it doesn’t already exist.

  Which type of installation should you choose?

   This depends on your requirements, but here is a short list of reasons why
   we recommend multi-user installation:

    Pros

     * Better build isolation (and that is what Nix is all about)
     * Better security (a build can not write somewhere in your home)
     * Sharing builds between users

    Cons

     * Requires root to run the daemon
     * More involved installation (creation of nixbld* users, installing a
       systemd unit, …
     * Harder to uninstall

  MacOS

  Multi-user installation

     Updating to macOS 15 Sequoia

     If you recently updated to macOS 15 Sequoia and are getting

 error: the user '_nixbld1' in the group 'nixbld' does not exist

     when running Nix commands, refer to GitHub issue NixOS/nix#10892 for
     instructions to fix your installation without reinstalling.

   Install Nix via the recommended multi-user installation:

 $ sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)

   We believe we have ironed out how to cleanly support the read-only root on
   modern macOS. Please consult the manual on details what the installation
   script does.

  Windows (WSL2)

  Multi-user installation (Requires WSL with systemd enabled)

   WSL versions 0.67.6 and above has systemd support. Follow Microsoft’s
   systemd guide to configure it, and then install Nix using:

 $ sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon

  Single-user installation

   Install Nix via the single-user installation

 $ sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --no-daemon

  Docker

   Start a Docker shell with Nix:

 $ docker run -it nixos/nix

   Or start a Docker shell with Nix exposing a workdir directory:

 $ mkdir workdir
 $ docker run -it -v $(pwd)/workdir:/workdir nixos/nix

   The workdir example from above can be also used to start hacking on
   nixpkgs:

 $ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git
 $ docker run -it -v $(pwd)/nixpkgs:/nixpkgs nixos/nix
 docker> nix-build -I nixpkgs=/nixpkgs -A hello
 docker> find ./result # this symlink points to the build package

                         NixOS : the Linux distribution

Current version

   24.05

  ISO image

   You can install NixOS on physical hardware by burning one of the CD images
   onto a blank CD/DVD disk, or by copying it onto a USB stick. For
   installation instructions, please see the manual.

  Graphical ISO image

   The graphical installation ISO image contains the graphical NixOS
   installer as well as a Desktop Environment and several applications. It’s
   a live CD, so it allows you to get an impression of NixOS (and the Nix
   package manager) without installing it.

   Download (GNOME, 64-bit Intel/AMD) (SHA-256) Recommended Download (GNOME,
   64-bit ARM) (SHA-256) Download (Plasma Desktop, 64-bit Intel/AMD)
   (SHA-256) Download (Plasma Desktop, 64-bit ARM) (SHA-256)

   Note that while the image itself only comes in GNOME and Plasma
   variations, the included installer also allows installing various other
   desktops, or installing without a desktop.

  Minimal ISO image

   The minimal installation ISO image does not contain the graphical user
   interface, and is therefore a lot smaller. You have to run the installer
   from the console. It contains a number of rescue tools.

  VirtualBox

   This is a demo appliance for VirtualBox (in OVA format).

   VirtualBox image includes the Plasma Desktop (was KDE) as well as the
   VirtualBox guest additions.

   Download (64-bit) (SHA-256)

  To use it

     * Download the OVA file using the button above.
     * Open VirtualBox.
     * Run File → Import Appliance from the menu.
     * Select previously downloaded OVA file.
     * Click Import.
     * You can then start the virtual machine.
     * You can log in as user demo, password demo.
     * To obtain a root shell, run sudo -i in the terminal (konsole).

  Amazon

NixOS AMIs

   NixOS can be deployed to Amazon EC2 using our official AMI. We publish
   AMIs to all AWS regions for both x86_64 and arm64 on a weekly basis.

   We will start deprecating and garbage collecting images older than 90 days
   in the future. This is why we suggest using a terraform data source or the
   AWS API to query for the latest AMI.

  Via Terraform / OpenTofu

   You can easily query for the latest AMI using a data source:

 provider "aws" {
   region = "eu-central-1"
 }
 data "aws_ami" "nixos_arm64" {
   owners      = ["427812963091"]
   most_recent = true
   filter {
     name   = "name"
     values = ["nixos/24.05*"]
   }
   filter {
     name   = "architecture"
     values = ["arm64"] # or "x86_64"
   }
 }
 resource "aws_instance" "nixos_arm64" {
   ami           = data.aws_ami.nixos_arm64.id
   instance_type = "t4g.nano"
 }

  Via Command Line / AWS API

   The DescribeImages API can be used to query the latest AMI too:

 aws ec2 describe-images --owners 427812963091 \
   --filter 'Name=name,Values=nixos/24.05*' \
   --filter 'Name=architecture,Values=arm64'

  Search for specific AMIs

   You can also use the Image searcher to find a specific AMI. Do note that
   we intend to deprecate images older than 90 days automatically and we do
   not recommend hardcoding AMI ids.
