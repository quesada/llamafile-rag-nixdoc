                                     Hydra

   CI

   Hydra is a Continuous Integration service for Nix based projects.

Installation And Setup

   Note: The instructions provided below are intended to enable new users to
   get a simple, local installation up and running. They are by no means
   sufficient for running a production server, let alone a public instance.

  Enabling The Service

   Running Hydra is currently only supported on NixOS. The hydra module
   allows for an easy setup. The following configuration can be used for a
   simple setup that performs all builds on localhost (Please refer to the
   Options page for all available options):

 {
   services.hydra = {
     enable = true;
     hydraURL = "http://localhost:3000";
     notificationSender = "hydra@localhost";
     buildMachinesFiles = [];
     useSubstitutes = true;
   };
 }

  Creating An Admin User

   Once the Hydra service has been configured as above and activate you
   should already be able to access the UI interface at the specified URL.
   However some actions require an admin user which has to be created first:

 $ su - hydra
 $ hydra-create-user <USER> --full-name '<NAME>' \
     --email-address '<EMAIL>' --password-prompt --role admin

   Afterwards you should be able to log by clicking on "Sign In" on the top
   right of the web interface using the credentials specified by
   hydra-create-user. Once you are logged in you can click "Admin -> Create
   Project" to configure your first project.

  Creating A Simple Project And Jobset

   In order to evaluate and build anything you need to create projects that
   contain jobsets. Hydra supports imperative and declarative projects and
   many different configurations. The steps below will guide you through the
   required steps to creating a minimal imperative project configuration.

    Creating A Project

   Log in as administrator, click "Admin" and select "Create project". Fill
   the form as follows:

     * Identifier: hello
     * Display name: hello
     * Description: hello project

   Click "Create project".

    Creating A Jobset

   After creating a project you are forwarded to the project page. Click
   "Actions" and choose "Create jobset". Fill the form with the following
   values:

     * Identifier: hello
     * Nix expression: examples/hello.nix in hydra
     * Check interval: 60
     * Scheduling shares: 1

   We have to add two inputs for this jobset. One for nixpkgs and one for
   hydra (which we are referencing in the Nix expression above):

     * Input name: nixpkgs

     * Type: Git checkout

     * Value: https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs-channels nixos-20.03

     * Input name: hydra

     * Type: Git checkout

     * Value: https://github.com/nixos/hydra

   Make sure State at the top of the page is set to "Enabled" and click on
   "Create jobset". This concludes the creation of a jobset that evaluates
   ./examples/hello.nix once a minute. Clicking "Evaluations" should list the
   first evaluation of the newly created jobset after a brief delay.

Building And Developing

  Building Hydra

   You can build Hydra via nix-build using the provided default.nix:

 $ nix-build

  Development Environment

   You can use the provided shell.nix to get a working development
   environment:

 $ nix-shell
 $ autoreconfPhase
 $ configurePhase # NOTE: not ./configure
 $ make

  Executing Hydra During Development

   When working on new features or bug fixes you need to be able to run Hydra
   from your working copy. This can be done using foreman:

 $ nix-shell
 $ # hack hack
 $ make
 $ foreman start

   Have a look at the Procfile if you want to see how the processes are being
   started. In order to avoid conflicts with services that might be running
   on your host, hydra and postgress are started on custom ports:

     * hydra-server: 63333 with the username "alice" and the password
       "foobar"
     * postgresql: 64444

   Note that this is only ever meant as an ad-hoc way of executing Hydra
   during development. Please make use of the NixOS module for actually
   running Hydra in production.

  Checking your patches

   After making your changes, verify the test suite passes and perlcritic is
   still happy.

   Start by following the steps in Development Environment.

   Then, you can run the tests and the perlcritic linter together with:

 $ nix-shell
 $ make check

   You can run a single test with:

 $ nix-shell
 $ yath test ./t/foo/bar.t

   And you can run just perlcritic with:

 $ nix-shell
 $ make perlcritic

  JSON API

   You can also interface with Hydra through a JSON API. The API is defined
   in hydra-api.yaml and you can test and explore via the swagger editor
