                                     NixOps

   Warning

   NixOps is in low-maintenance mode and probably not suited for new
   projects. Use at your own risks.

   Note

   An experimental rewrite of NixOps is happening under
   https://github.com/nixops4/nixops4

   Test

   NixOps is a tool for deploying to NixOS machines in a network or the
   cloud. Key features include:

     * Declarative: NixOps determines and carries out actions necessary to
       realise a deployment configuration.
     * Testable: Try your deployments on VirtualBox or libvirtd.
     * Multi Cloud Support: Currently supports deployments to AWS, Hetzner,
       and GCE
     * Separation of Concerns: Deployment descriptions are divided into
       logical and physical aspects. This makes it easy to separate parts
       that say what a machine should do from where they should do it.
     * Extensible: NixOps is extensible through a plugin infrastructure which
       can be used to provide additional backends.

   For more information, please refer to the NixOps manual.

  Running

   NixOps is included in nixpkgs and can be executed in a shell as follows:

 $ nix-shell -p nixops

   or for a bleeding edge version, including many fixes relative to the 1.7
   series,

 $ nix-shell -p nixopsUnstable

   You may need access to a Nix remote builder if your system does not
   support the deployment's system builds directly. MacOS users may use a
   virtual machine with NixOS for this purpose.

   It is also possible to use cross-compilation with NixOps, by setting
   nixpkgs.localSystem and nixpkgs.crossSystem. A mix of remote, emulated and
   cross builds is also possible; see this writeup on eno.space.

  Building And Developing

    Building The Nix Package

   You can build the Nix package by simply invoking nix-build on the project
   root:

 $ nix-build

    Development Shell

   shell.nix provides an environment with all dependencies required for
   working on NixOps. You can use nix-shell to enter a shell suitable for
   working on NixOps which will contain all Python dependencies specified in
   pyproject.toml

 $ nix-shell

    Executing Tests

   Inside the development shell the tests can be executed as follows:

 $ pytest

    Documentation

   NixOps' documentation uses reStructuredText. When editing the docs, get a
   live-reloading, rendered version of the docs:

 nixops$ ./live-docs.py
 Serving on http://127.0.0.1:5500

   and verify its lints before committing:

 nixops$ lint-docs

  Contributing

   Contributions to the project are welcome in the form of GitHub PRs. Please
   consider the following guidelines before creating PRs:

     * Please make sure to format your code using black.
     * Please add type signatures using mypy.
     * If you are planning to make any considerable changes, you should first
       present your plans in a GitHub issue so it can be discussed.
     * If you are adding features, please also add reasonable tests.
