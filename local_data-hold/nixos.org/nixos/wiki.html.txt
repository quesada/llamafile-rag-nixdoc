    Getting started

   This is the official NixOS Wiki. It includes topics not covered in the
   NixOS Manual: NixOS user guides, configuration examples, and
   troubleshooting tips.

   NixOS is a Linux operating system based on the Nix package manager and the
   Nixpkgs package repository.

   Newcomers to NixOS are encouraged to read the Nix Core Ecosystem overview
   article to get a comprehensive orientation. For more specific
   introductions, see:

     * NixOS
     * Nix package manager
     * Nixpkgs package repository
     * Nix Language

   If you want to try Nix standalone in another Linux distribution or on a
   Mac, take your first steps on nix.dev.

   Much great additional tooling exists in the Nix ecosystem such as:

     * Home-manager to manage user profile & home directory contents
     * Nix Flakes instead of nix-channel

   These add complexity and may be confusing at first, and you may even
   decide that you don't need them. Start with plain Nix/NixOS, and only
   integrate Home Manager and/or Flakes into your setup once you're confident
   with Nix/NixOS and comprehend their significance.

    Setting up NixOS
     * On desktop, with NixOS as a desktop
     * On ARM, with NixOS on ARM
     * In the cloud, with NixOS friendly hosters
