   Nix Steering Committee Election 2024 Announcement

                               Declarative builds
                                and deployments.

   Nix is a tool that takes a unique approach to package management and
   system configuration. Learn how to make reproducible, declarative and
   reliable systems.

   Download Get started

Reproducible

   Nix builds packages in isolation from each other. This ensures that they
   are reproducible and don’t have undeclared dependencies, so if a package
   works on one machine, it will also work on another.

Declarative

   Nix makes it trivial to share development and build environments for your
   projects, regardless of what programming languages and tools you’re using.

Reliable

   Nix ensures that installing or upgrading one package cannot break other
   packages. It allows you to roll back to previous versions, and ensures
   that no package is in an inconsistent state during an upgrade.

Choose from Thousands of Packages

   The Nix Packages collection (Nixpkgs) is a set of over 100 000 packages
   for the Nix package manager.
