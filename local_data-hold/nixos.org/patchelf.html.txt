   PatchELF is a simple utility for modifying existing ELF executables and
   libraries. In particular, it can do the following:

     * Change the dynamic loader ("ELF interpreter") of executables:

 $ patchelf --set-interpreter /lib/my-ld-linux.so.2 my-program

     * Change the RPATH of executables and libraries:

 $ patchelf --set-rpath /opt/my-libs/lib:/other-libs my-program

     * Shrink the RPATH of executables and libraries:

 $ patchelf --shrink-rpath my-program

       This removes from the RPATH all directories that do not contain a
       library referenced by DT_NEEDED fields of the executable or library.
       For instance, if an executable references one library libfoo.so, has
       an RPATH /lib:/usr/lib:/foo/lib, and libfoo.so can only be found in
       /foo/lib, then the new RPATH will be /foo/lib.

       In addition, the --allowed-rpath-prefixes option can be used for
       further rpath tuning. For instance, if an executable has an RPATH
       /tmp/build-foo/.libs:/foo/lib, it is probably desirable to keep the
       /foo/lib reference instead of the /tmp entry. To accomplish that, use:

 $ patchelf --shrink-rpath --allowed-rpath-prefixes /usr/lib:/foo/lib my-program

     * Remove declared dependencies on dynamic libraries (DT_NEEDED entries):

 $ patchelf --remove-needed libfoo.so.1 my-program

       This option can be given multiple times.

     * Add a declared dependency on a dynamic library (DT_NEEDED):

 $ patchelf --add-needed libfoo.so.1 my-program

       This option can be give multiple times.

     * Replace a declared dependency on a dynamic library with another one
       (DT_NEEDED):

 $ patchelf --replace-needed liboriginal.so.1 libreplacement.so.1 my-program

       This option can be give multiple times.

     * Change SONAME of a dynamic library:

 $ patchelf --set-soname libnewname.so.3.4.5 path/to/libmylibrary.so.1.2.3

Compiling and Testing

  Via Autotools

 ./bootstrap.sh
 ./configure
 make
 make check
 sudo make install

  Via Nix

   You can build with Nix in several ways.

    1. Building via nix build will produce the result in
       ./result/bin/patchelf. If you would like to build patchelf with musl
       try nix build .#patchelf-musl

    2. You can launch a development environment with nix develop and follow
       the autotools steps above. If you would like to develop with musl try
       nix develop .#musl
