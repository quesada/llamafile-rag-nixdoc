   1Password is a password manager.

NixOS

  Installation

   If you're using NixOS, you can enable 1Password and its GUI with:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 { config, lib, pkgs, ... }:
 {
   # Enable the unfree 1Password packages
   nixpkgs.config.allowUnfreePredicate = pkg: builtins.elem (lib.getName pkg) [
     "1password-gui"
     "1password"
   ];
   # Alternatively, you could also just allow all unfree packages
   # nixpkgs.config.allowUnfree = true;

   programs._1password.enable = true;
   programs._1password-gui = {
     enable = true;
     # Certain features, including CLI integration and system authentication support,
     # require enabling PolKit integration on some desktop environments (e.g. Plasma).
     polkitPolicyOwners = [ "yourUsernameHere" ];
   };
   ...
 }

  Unlocking browser extensions

   Warning: This only works for browsers that are installed via NixOS.
   Browsers installed via Flatpak are not supported.

   The 1Password app can unlock your browser extension using a special native
   messaging process. This streamlines your 1Password experience: Once you
   unlock 1Password from your tray icon, your browser extensions will be
   unlocked as well.

   This is automatically configured for Firefox, Chrome, and Brave browsers.
   However, Vivaldi and other custom Chrome-based browsers may not unlock
   when you unlock 1Password. If you find this to be the case, the solution
   is to set the /etc/1password/custom_allowed_browsers file as follows:

     * First, use ps aux to find the application name for the browser. For
       Vivaldi, this is vivaldi-bin
     * Add that binary name to /etc/1password/custom_allowed_browsers:

     environment.etc = {
       "1password/custom_allowed_browsers" = {
         text = ''
           vivaldi-bin
           wavebox
         '';
         mode = "0755";
       };
     };

Home Manager

   Warning: Non-NixOS installs will not link with browser extensions or
   system authentication

  Installation

   Add the following to your Home Manager configuration:

   home.packages = [
     pkgs._1password
     pkgs._1password-gui
   ];

  SSH key management

   1Password can manage SSH keys.

    Configuring SSH

   If 1Password manages your SSH keys and you use Home Manager, you may also
   configure your ~/.ssh/config file using Nix:

   Note: In order to start the 1Password SSH agent, you must open the
   1Password settings, go to the Developer section and check the checkbox
   "Use the SSH agent".

 _: let
   # onePassPath = "~/Library/Group Containers/2BUA8C4S2C.com.1password/t/agent.sock";
   onePassPath = "~/.1password/agent.sock";
 in {
   programs.ssh = {
     enable = true;
     extraConfig = ''
       Host *
           IdentityAgent ${onePassPath}
     '';
   };
 }

    Configuring Git

   You can enable Git's SSH singing with Home Manager:

 {
   programs.git = {
     enable = true;
     extraConfig = {
       gpg = {
         format = "ssh";
       };
       "gpg \"ssh\"" = {
         program = "${lib.getExe' pkgs._1password-gui "op-ssh-sign"}";
       };
       commit = {
         gpgsign = true;
       };

       user = {
         signingKey = "...";
       };
     };
   };
 }
