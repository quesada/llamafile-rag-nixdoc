What is 3proxy

   3proxy is universal proxy server. It can be used to provide internal users
   with fully controllable access to external resources or to provide
   external users with access to internal resources. 3proxy is not developed
   to replace squid, but it can extend functionality of existing cashing
   proxy. It can be used to route requests between different types of clients
   and proxy servers. Think about it as application level gateway with
   configuration like hardware router has for network layer. It can establish
   multiple gateways with HTTP and HTTPS proxy with FTP over HTTP support,
   SOCKS v4, v4.5 and v5, POP3 proxy, UDP and TCP portmappers.

Sample configuration

   Just add the following to your configuration.nix file:

   services._3proxy = {
     enable = true;
     services = [
       {
         type = "socks";
           auth = [ "strong" ];
           acl = [ {
             rule = "allow";
             users = [ "test1" ];
           }
         ];
       }
     ];
     usersFile = "/etc/3proxy.passwd";
   };

   environment.etc = {
     "3proxy.passwd".text = ''
       test1:CL:password1
       test2:CR:$1$rkpibm5J$Aq1.9VtYAn0JrqZ8M.1ME.
     '';
   };

   This sample configuration runs a single instance as socks proxy with
   user/password auth. The password can be clear text, as indicated by the CL
   for user test1 or it can be encrypted as indicated by the CR for user
   test2. You can generate md5-crypted passwords via
   https://unix4lyfe.org/crypt/

   Note: The htpasswd tool generates incompatible md5-crypted passwords (see
   https://github.com/z3APA3A/3proxy/wiki/How-To-(incomplete)#USERS )

Firewall

   If not set otherwise, open port 3128 on the firewall.

Firefox

   To use in Firefox, you can install the FoxyProxy addon and create a new
   proxy. Give it a name, use SOCKS5 and provide the proxy's ip address or
   domain name. If not set otherwise, use port 3128 and provider username and
   password.
