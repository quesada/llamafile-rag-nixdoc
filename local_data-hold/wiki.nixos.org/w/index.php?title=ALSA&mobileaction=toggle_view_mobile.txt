   ALSA is the kernel-level sound API for Linux. On modern systems, it is
   usually used via a sound server like PulseAudio.

Save volume state on shutdown

   In order to save the sound card state on shutdown sound must be enabled in
   configuration.nix

 sound.enable = true;

Troubleshooting ALSA

     * on a console fire up alsamixer

  alsamixer

     * you see plenty of vertical bars?
          * you should be okay
     * you see very few vertical bars and the sound card (top-left) is
       something like "PC Speaker"?
          * hit the 'S' key, you should be able to switch to the "real" audio
            card (if not your audio card is likely to not being supported
            yet).
          * when the real audio card is selected you should be viewing the
            "plenty vertical bars" thing.
               * first thing to do is to disable pc speaker (kernel module
                 "snd-pcsp", see below.

  Make your audio card the default ALSA card

   Sometimes the pc-speaker is the default audio card for ALSA. You can make
   your real sound card default instead. For example, if your sound card is
   "hda-intel" then add

 boot.extraModprobeConfig = ''
   options snd slots=snd-hda-intel
 '';

   to your /etc/nixos/configuration.nix.

   Sometimes, we may want to disable one of intel cards. Here is how to
   disable first card, but enable the second one.

 boot.extraModprobeConfig = ''
   options snd_hda_intel enable=0,1
 '';

   Alternatively you can ...

  Disable PC Speaker "audio card"

   edit /etc/nixos/configuration.nix and add "snd_pcsp" to
   boot.blacklistedKernelModules option:

 boot.blacklistedKernelModules = [ "snd_pcsp" ];

   Now reboot and retry from the beginning (i.e. check that your real card is
   shown by alsamixer without using the 'S' key).

  Other hardware specific problems

   Some hardware specific problems can be resolved by adjusting the options
   for the sound module. For example, the microphone may be stuck on an
   unusably low volume. First you should be sure that you have already
   checked the settings in alsamixer to make sure nothing is muted, and also
   any physical buttons on your computer (I have twice overlooked the mute
   button on laptops!).

   You should be able to look up the available options for model in
   models.rst. You can try them out interactively as follows:

    1. Close any applications using the sound card
         1. See if any applications are using the sound card

                         $ lsof /dev/snd/*
                         COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
                         pulseaudi 14080 goibhniu 30u CHR 116,7 0t0 5169
                         /dev/snd/controlC0
                         pulseaudi 14080 goibhniu 37u CHR 116,7 0t0 5169
                         /dev/snd/controlC0

         2. Kill them

                         for any process apart from pulseaudio you could just
                         do:
                         $ kill -9 14080
                         but in the case of pulseaudio you have to prevent it
                         from respawning itself automatically
                         $ systemctl --user mask pulseaudio.socket &&
                         systemctl --user stop pulseaudio
                         you can then stop pulseaudio with:
                         $ pulseaudio -k # or kill it by process id

    2. Unload the snd-hda-intel module

                    rmmod snd-hda-intel

    3. Find your model

                    grep Codec /proc/asound/card0/codec*

    4. Look up the model options for your card
    5. Try each one

                    modprobe snd-hda-intel model=3stack-6ch

    6. Test if this has fixed your problem (tip: aplay and arecord are alsa
       based command line tools you can use to quickly check)
    7. Repeat until you have exhausted all the options or have fixed your
       problem
    8. TIDY UP!

                    Don't forget to re-enable pulse autospawning: systemctl
                    --user unmask pulseaudio.socket

   Once you have found a setting that works, you can add it to your
   configuration file:

 boot.extraModprobeConfig = ''
   options snd-hda-intel model=YOUR_MODEL
 '';

   additional tips.
