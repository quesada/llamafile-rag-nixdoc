   Accelerated video playback in NixOS is generally done by adding relevant
   packages to hardware.opengl.extraPackages.

Installation

  Intel

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 {
   hardware.graphics = { # hardware.opengl in 24.05 and older
     enable = true;
     extraPackages = with pkgs; [
       intel-media-driver # For Broadwell (2014) or newer processors. LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=iHD
       intel-vaapi-driver # For older processors. LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=i965
     ];
   };
   environment.sessionVariables = { LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME = "iHD"; }; # Optionally, set the environment variable
 }

   Note, intel-vaapi-driver still performs better for browsers
   (gecko/chromium based) on newer Skylake (2015) processors.^[1]

   For 32-bit support, use hardware.graphics.extraPackages32:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 {
   # hardware.opengl.extraPackages32 in 24.05
   hardware.graphics.extraPackages32 = with pkgs.pkgsi686Linux; [ intel-vaapi-driver ];
 }

  AMD

   AMD configuration (at least for Ryzen 5 iGPUs) works out of the box:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 {
   hardware.opengl.enable = true;
 }

Testing your configuration

   You can test your configuration by running: nix-shell -p libva-utils --run
   vainfo See Arch Linux wiki#Hardware video acceleration for more
   information.

Applications

  Chromium

   See Chromium#Accelerated_video_playback.

  Firefox

   See Arch Linux wiki#Firefox.

  MPV

   You can place the following configuration in ~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf:

 hwdec=auto-safe
 vo=gpu
 profile=gpu-hq
 gpu-context=wayland ; On wayland only

   See Arch Linux wiki#mpv.

     * nixos-hardware has example configurations for various types of
       hardware.
