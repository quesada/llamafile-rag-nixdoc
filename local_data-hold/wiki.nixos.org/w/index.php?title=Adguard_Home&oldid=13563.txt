    This article or section needs expansion.                                  
    Reason: This article is a stub. (Discuss in Talk:Adguard Home#)           
    Please consult the pedia article metapage for guidelines on contributing. 

Example config

   services.adguardhome = {
     enable = true;
     settings = {
       http = {
         # You can select any ip and port, just make sure to open firewalls where needed
         address = "127.0.0.1:3003";
       };
       dns = {
         upstream_dns = [
           # Example config with quad9
           "9.9.9.9#dns.quad9.net"
           "149.112.112.112#dns.quad9.net"
           # Uncomment the following to use a local DNS service (e.g. Unbound)
           # Additionally replace the address & port as needed
           # "127.0.0.1:5335"
         ];
       };
       filtering = {
         protection_enabled = true;
         filtering_enabled = true;

         parental_enabled = false;  # Parental control-based DNS requests filtering.
         safe_search = {
           enabled = false;  # Enforcing "Safe search" option for search engines, when possible.
         };
       };
       # The following notation uses map
       # to not have to manually create {enabled = true; url = "";} for every filter
       # This is, however, fully optional
       filters = map(url: { enabled = true; url = url; }) [
         "https://adguardteam.github.io/HostlistsRegistry/assets/filter_9.txt"  # The Big List of Hacked Malware Web Sites
         "https://adguardteam.github.io/HostlistsRegistry/assets/filter_11.txt"  # malicious url blocklist
       ];
     };
   };
