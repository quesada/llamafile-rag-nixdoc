Nixpkgs replacements

   Even though Nixpkgs is currently the standard package set for Nix and
   NixOS, it can be replaced by another with different conventions and/or
   functionality. An alternative package set may build upon certain aspects
   of Nixpkgs, but more often than not it serves a distinct purpose.

   This is a list of Nixpkgs alternatives:

     * Nixcrpkgs Focused on cross-compiling
     * Triton - differences between Nixpkgs and Triton
     * liminix Build Router images with nix, based on nixpkgs
