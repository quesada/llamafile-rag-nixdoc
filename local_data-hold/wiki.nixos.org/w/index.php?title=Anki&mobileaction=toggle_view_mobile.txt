   From NixOS Wiki

   Anki is a spaced repetition system (SRS) commonly used to learn new
   languages. Information is placed on individual flashcards, which are
   sorted into decks. Anki is extensible using Python addons.

   In addition to the desktop software, Anki has an iOS app, Android app, and
   web interface available. Decks/flashcards can be synced using a self
   hosted instance of ankisyncd or an AnkiWeb account.

Installation

   anki-bin and anki are available.

   NixOs

 environment.systemPackages = [
   pkgs.anki-bin
 ];

   nix-shell

   $ nix-shell -p anki-bin
