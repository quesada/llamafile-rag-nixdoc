   AppImage is a monolithic packaging format for linux applications. It
   contains all dependencies in one file that is composed of an executable
   with a tacked on filesystem.

Usage

  Run

   On most distros, all one has to do is download the .AppImage file, make it
   executable chmod +x $AppImage, and execute it. This doesn't work in NixOS
   out of the box though, as AppImage files usually (if not always) depend on
   certain system libraries in hardcoded paths.

 $ nix-shell -p appimage-run
 $ appimage-run $AppImageFile

  Packaging

   See the nixpkgs manual on wrapping AppImage packages. In short, the
   AppImage is extracted and any dependencies are added as nix build
   dependencies.

   Following example is a derivation for the program Quba, which is also
   distributed as AppImage.

 {
   lib,
   appimageTools,
   fetchurl,
 }:

 let
   version = "1.4.0";
   pname = "quba";
   name = "${pname}-${version}";

   src = fetchurl {
     url = "https://github.com/ZUGFeRD/quba-viewer/releases/download/v${version}/Quba-${version}.AppImage";
     hash = "sha256-EsTF7W1np5qbQQh3pdqsFe32olvGK3AowGWjqHPEfoM=";
   };

   appimageContents = appimageTools.extractType1 { inherit name src; };
 in
 appimageTools.wrapType1 {
   inherit name src;

   extraInstallCommands = ''
     mv $out/bin/${name} $out/bin/${pname}
     install -m 444 -D ${appimageContents}/${pname}.desktop -t $out/share/applications
     substituteInPlace $out/share/applications/${pname}.desktop \
       --replace-fail 'Exec=AppRun' 'Exec=${pname}'
     cp -r ${appimageContents}/usr/share/icons $out/share
   '';

   meta = {
     description = "Viewer for electronic invoices";
     homepage = "https://github.com/ZUGFeRD/quba-viewer";
     downloadPage = "https://github.com/ZUGFeRD/quba-viewer/releases";
     license = lib.licenses.asl20;
     sourceProvenance = with lib.sourceTypes; [ binaryNativeCode ];
     maintainers = with lib.maintainers; [ onny ];
     platforms = [ "x86_64-linux" ];
   };
 }

Configuration

  Register AppImage files as a binary type to binfmt_misc

   You can tell the Linux kernel to use an interpreter (e.g. appimage-run)
   when executing certain binary files through the use of binfmt_misc, either
   by filename extension or magic number matching. Below NixOS configuration
   registers AppImage files (ELF files with magic number "AI" + 0x02) to be
   run with appimage-run as interpreter.

   Since NixOS 24.05, there is a binfmt option:

 programs.appimage = {
   enable = true;
   binfmt = true;
 };

   This way AppImage files can be invoked directly as if they were normal
   programs
