   This article lists applications built for and with Nix; it constitutes a
   listing of what may be called the Extended Nix Ecosystem (see Nix
   Ecosystem for the Core Nix Ecosystem).

   If you are looking for Linux software/applications you should look at
   Software or its sub-article Applications.

           source, per-user subscription for private repositories.

   Garnix
           nix CI, caching (open beta) and cloud hosting (private alpha)
           based on Nix as a service. Currently free, but offers commerical
           plans.
