   Augustus is an engine to run the 1998 game Caesar III with modern
   improvements (higher resolution, ..). Caesar III is a city builder with
   complex manufacturing and optional military path.

   You need the orginal Caesar III game files to run Augustus.

   Augustus is a fork of Julius. This article also applies for „Julius“, for
   Julius just install the „julius“ instead of the „augustus“ package.

   The three versions of the game:

     * Caesar III/ Caesar 3: 1998 version of the game
     * Julius: Modern engine to run the game. The game itself is true to
       Caesar III.
     * Augustus: Based on Julius but with more changes in gameplay compared
       to Julius.

Install game

     * Install the game: You can e.g. install the GOG version of Caesar III
       via Lutris: https://lutris.net/games/caesar-iii/
     * Install the augustus engine: just add the package to your NixOS
       configuration and rebuild:

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ augustus ];

Install modifications

  Better music files

   see: https://github.com/bvschaik/julius-support/releases/tag/music

  Better videos

   see:
   https://www.moddb.com/mods/caesar-3-restored-cinematics-v10/downloads/caesar-3-restored-cinematics-v101

Troubleshooting: It is impossible set the game path

   Due to your settings of your desktop environment and shell settings it may
   not be possible to choose the path of the installed Caesar III game. You
   can always use the terminal to start „augustus“ in the path where the
   c3.exe is.
