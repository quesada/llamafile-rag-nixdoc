   Automatic system upgrades can be used to upgrade a system regularly at a
   specific time. This can help to reduce the time period of applying
   important security patches to your running software but might also
   introduce some breakage in case an automatic upgrade fails. For automatic
   upgrades an automatic garbage collection is important to prevent full
   /boot and / partitions.

Configuration

   To enable unattended automatic system updates on a flake-enabled host, add
   following part to your configuration:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 system.autoUpgrade = {
   enable = true;
   flake = inputs.self.outPath;
   flags = [
     "--update-input"
     "nixpkgs"
     "--print-build-logs"
   ];
   dates = "02:00";
   randomizedDelaySec = "45min";
 };

   To see the status of the timer run

 # systemctl status nixos-upgrade.timer

   The upgrade log can be printed with this command

 # systemctl status nixos-upgrade.service
