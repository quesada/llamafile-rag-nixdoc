   From NixOS Wiki

   BOINC lets you contribute computing power on your home PC to projects
   doing research in many scientific areas. You can contribute to a single
   project, or to any combination of them. To install and enable BOINC on
   NixOS, add this to your configuration.nix:

 services.boinc.enable = true;
 services.boinc.extraEnvPackages = [ pkgs.libglvnd pkgs.brotli ]; #Rosetta Beta 6.05 needs libGL.so.1 and libbrotlidec.so.1

   Then to open the BOINC Manager, you can run the command boincmgr.
