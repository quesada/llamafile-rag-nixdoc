   This page documents methods for controlling backlight (aka screen
   brightness) and tips to control it via hotkeys.

Kernel native

   Some laptops, using a recent enough kernel, will automatically handle
   increasing and decreasing the backlight using the hot keys. The following
   tools will allow scripting or controlling the backlight using other means,
   if desired.

Desktop Environment native

   Some desktop environments will handle querying and setting the backlight,
   including configuring the backlight keys. These include at least: Plasma
   (KDE) and XFCE. It may be needed to configure or start some desktop
   environment-specific services.

xbacklight

   xbacklight uses X to change the light settings. This can be inconvenient
   in some situations, e.g. for use with the services.actkbd service, which
   doesn't know about the X session. It, though, has an history of being more
   compatible with different hardware, especially newer hardware^[citation
   needed]

   To install xbacklight globally, add this to your configuration.nix.

   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ xorg.xbacklight ];

   Alternatively, use nix-env -iA nixos.xorg.xbacklight to install it to your
   user profile.

light

   light does not use X to change the light settings. This can be used in
   situations where the X service isn't available. While it does not use X,
   it will need some privileges to work.

   To enable the use of light, add this to your configuration.nix and make
   sure that your user is a member of the video group.

   programs.light.enable = true;

   The following commands will allow you to test light:

     * light -U 30 — the screen should become darker.
     * light -A 30 — the screen should become brighter.

   Be careful using light -U, as you might turn your backlight completely
   off! You will not be able to see what you're typing anymore.

brightnessctl

   brightnessctl (homepage) is another option, which, like light, would work
   even without X or on Wayland.

   You can use it by simply installing the package. Since brightnessctl
   supports the systemd-logind API it should work out of the box (i.e.
   without installing any udev rules or using a setuid wrapper).

   The following commands will allow you to test brightnessctl:

     * brightnessctl set 5%- - the screen should become darker.
     * brightnessctl set 5%+ - the screen should become brighter.

   If you get an error like Failed to set brightness: Protocol error, check
   that you are using the right device. You can get a list of the devices
   with running brightnessctl -l and then specify the device with -d
   deviceName.

   Example: brightnessctl set 5%- -d intel_backlight

/sys/class/backlight/...

   The /sys/class/backlight/*/brightness files are a built-in way to set
   brightness. Use them e.g. with:

   sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness <<< 300

   to set the brightness to 300, where the maximum is stored in
   brightness_max. You can set file permissions e.g. with a udev rule, if you
   don't want to use sudo. Here is an example udev rule, where you will
   likely have to replace intel_backlight, with the name in your
   /sys/class/backlight/:

   services.udev.extraRules = ''
     ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="backlight", KERNEL=="intel_backlight", MODE="0666", RUN+="${pkgs.coreutils}/bin/chmod a+w /sys/class/backlight/%k/brightness"
   '';

Tips

  Key mapping

   While controlling the backlight via the command line is useful, it would
   be preferable to control it using key bindings. This is especially true
   considering most laptops have backlight control keys.

   There are two main choices to add key bindings, using a system-level
   service like actkbd or using an X session tool, either provided by your
   Desktop environment, Window manager or a tool like xbindkeys.

   Depending on the tools that work for controlling the backlight you will be
   able to choose one of those options.

                  light xbacklight 
   System service Yes   With hacks 
   X session      Yes   Yes        

   Follows, an example mapping for use with actkbd:

   Note: This was verified to work with
     * NixOS 18.03 on a Lenovo T440 and
     * NixOS 19.09pre173166.373488e6f4c on a Lenovo X240
   it may work on other models, but is unconfirmed. See actkbd for details on
   finding out the proper key bindings. Also check if the path to the light
   binary is correct.

   programs.light.enable = true;
   services.actkbd = {
     enable = true;
     bindings = [
       { keys = [ 224 ]; events = [ "key" ]; command = "/run/current-system/sw/bin/light -A 10"; }
       { keys = [ 225 ]; events = [ "key" ]; command = "/run/current-system/sw/bin/light -U 10"; }
     ];
   };

OLED Screens

   OLED screens do not have a backlight, but their perceived brightness can
   be changed via xrandr:

     * xrandr --output <output> --brightness .5 - dim to 50%
     * xrandr --output <output> --brightness 1 - no dimming
