   From NixOS Wiki

   The Battle.net launcher is an application to start Blizzard games. It can
   be installed and launched via wine, which works pretty well. To play most
   of its games a recent wine-staging version is recommended.

Setup

   Tested on nixos-unstable with wine-staging 5.22 and found to be working
   with World of Warcraft 9.0.2:

  users.users.youruser.packages = with pkgs; [
    (wineWowPackages.full.override {
      wineRelease = "staging";
      mingwSupport = true;
    })
    winetricks
  ];

   Create a 64-bit wine prefix and enable DXVK support.

  export WINEARCH=win64
  export WINEPREFIX=$HOME/.wine-battlenet
  winetricks dxvk

   Download the Battle.net-Setup.exe from
   https://www.blizzard.com/apps/battle.net/desktop and install it by
   executing

  wine64 Battle.net-Setup.exe

   Follow the installation and upon completion login in with your Battle.net
   Id or create one.

   The Launcher should now start up and allow you to install and launch
   games.

Updating NixOS and the Battle.net Client

   After updating any wine related packages the Battle.net client may throw
   an error on launch.

   Re-run the `wine64 Battle.net-Setup.exe` inside the previous wine prefix
   you used to update the application and avoid this error.

Steam

   Alternatively, you can install Steam and then add the Battle.net installer
   there via "Add Game -> Add a Non-Steam Game...". You must also go to the
   Properties of the added game in Steam and set Compatibility to
   GE-Proton8-25 (or later version).

   If you get stuck on the login screen where there are no login buttons, you
   must launch the Steam app with "WINE_SIMULATE_WRITECOPY=1" env variable.
   This might be just a temporary glitch. You can also add Battle.net client
   or even the game directly to Steam. Look for installed binaries (.exe) in
   "~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/".
