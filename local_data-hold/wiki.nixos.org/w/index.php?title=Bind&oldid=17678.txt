   BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is one of the most widely used DNS
   servers.

Caching DNS resolver

   If you are trying to setup bind as a simple DNS resolver, this can be
   configured using all the default options. You'll just need to enable the
   service:

 { ... }:
 {
   services.bind = {
     enable = true;
   };
 }

Serving DNS for Your Domain

   To run BIND as the primary DNS server for your domain, you can start with
   this config:

 { pkgs, ... }:
 {
   services.bind = {
     enable = true;
     zones = {
       "example.com" = {
         master = true;
         file = pkgs.writeText "zone-example.com" ''
           $ORIGIN example.com.
           $TTL    1h
           @            IN      SOA     ns1 hostmaster (
                                            1    ; Serial
                                            3h   ; Refresh
                                            1h   ; Retry
                                            1w   ; Expire
                                            1h)  ; Negative Cache TTL
                        IN      NS      ns1
                        IN      NS      ns2

           @            IN      A       203.0.113.1
                        IN      AAAA    2001:db8:113::1
                        IN      MX      10 mail
                        IN      TXT     "v=spf1 mx"

           www          IN      A       203.0.113.1
                        IN      AAAA    2001:db8:113::1

           ns1          IN      A       203.0.113.4
                        IN      AAAA    2001:db8:113::4

           ns2          IN      A       198.51.100.5
                        IN      AAAA    2001:db8:5100::5
         '';
       };
     };
   };
 }

   You'll need to modify the zone file to match your use case. You can lookup
   other common setups in BIND's documentation.

Split DNS resolver

   Split DNS allows you to manage privately resolving DNS records for a
   network, while also resolving queries for other websites. This is common
   in VPN setups, and it used by providers such as tailscale. You may want to
   configure the networks that can use BIND as a cache (using cacheNetworks)
   and the networks that can query your private hosted zones (using
   allowQuery).

 { pkgs, ... }:
 {
   services.bind = {
     enable = true;
     cacheNetworks = [ "127.0.0.0/24" "::1/128" "192.168.0.0/24" ];
     zones = {
       "example.com" = {
         master = true;
         allowQuery = [ "127.0.0.0/24" "::1/128" "192.168.0.0/24" ];
         file = pkgs.writeText "zone-example.com" ''
           ...
         '';
       };
     };
   };
 }
