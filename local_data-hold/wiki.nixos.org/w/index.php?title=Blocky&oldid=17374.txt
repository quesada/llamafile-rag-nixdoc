   Blocky is a DNS proxy and ad-blocker for the local network written in Go.
   It provides network wide adblocking similar to Pi-hole while offering
   additional features (and it's in nixpkgs).

Configuration Examples

 services.blocky = {
     enable = true;
     settings = {
       ports.dns = 53; # Port for incoming DNS Queries.
       upstreams.groups.default = [
         "https://one.one.one.one/dns-query" # Using Cloudflare's DNS over HTTPS server for resolving queries.
       ];
       # For initially solving DoH/DoT Requests when no system Resolver is available.
       bootstrapDns = {
         upstream = "https://one.one.one.one/dns-query";
         ips = [ "1.1.1.1" "1.0.0.1" ];
       };
       #Enable Blocking of certain domains.
       blocking = {
         denylists = {
           #Adblocking
           ads = ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts"];
           #Another filter for blocking adult sites
           adult = ["https://blocklistproject.github.io/Lists/porn.txt"];
           #You can add additional categories
         };
         #Configure what block categories are used
         clientGroupsBlock = {
           default = [ "ads" ];
           kids-ipad = ["ads" "adult"];
         };
       };
     };
   };

Adding Additional Functionality

   To add a cache of DNS Requests and Prefetching add:

 caching = {
   minTime = "5m";
   maxTime = "30m"
   prefetching = true;
 };
