Setup

   To enable support for Bluetooth devices, amend your system configuration
   as follows and apply changes:

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 hardware.bluetooth.enable = true;

Usage

   In order to use Bluetooth devices, they must be paired with your NixOS
   machine. Heavier desktop environments will usually provide a Bluetooth
   management GUI which you can use to pair devices.

   If your desktop environment does not provide such a GUI, you can
   additionally enable the blueman service, which provides blueman-applet and
   blueman-manager with the snippet below.

 services.blueman.enable = true;

   Another option for a GUI based Bluetooth management GUI can be overskirde

   Alternatively if you wish to use a TUI^[1] then check out bluetuith or
   bluetui

  Pairing devices from the command line

   Alternatively, Bluetooth devices can be paired from the command line using
   bluetoothctl.

 $ bluetoothctl
 [bluetooth] # power on
 [bluetooth] # agent on
 [bluetooth] # default-agent
 [bluetooth] # scan on
 ...put device in pairing mode and wait [hex-address] to appear here...
 [bluetooth] # pair [hex-address]
 [bluetooth] # connect [hex-address]

   Bluetooth devices automatically connect with bluetoothctl as well:

 $ bluetoothctl
 [bluetooth] # trust [hex-address]

Using Bluetooth headsets with PulseAudio

   To allow Bluetooth audio devices to be used with PulseAudio, amend
   /etc/nixos/configuration.nix as follows:

 {
   hardware.pulseaudio.enable = true;
   hardware.bluetooth.enable = true;
 }

    Tip                                                                       
    In order to affect your system by your nix-language-specific changes you  
    have to evaluate it, run (as root):                                       
                                                                              
    # nixos-rebuild switch                                                    

   You will need to restart PulseAudio; try systemctl --user daemon-reload;
   systemctl --user restart pulseaudio.

   You can verify that PulseAudio has loaded the Bluetooth module by running
   pactl list | grep -i 'Name.*module.*blue'; Bluetooth modules should be
   present in the list.

Using Bluetooth headset buttons to control media player

   Some bluetooth headsets have buttons for pause/play or to skip to the next
   track. To make these buttons usable with media players supporting the
   dbus-based MPRIS standard, one can use mpris-proxy that is part of bluez
   package. The following snippet can be used in Home Manager to start this
   program as a daemon:

 systemd.user.services.mpris-proxy = {
     description = "Mpris proxy";
     after = [ "network.target" "sound.target" ];
     wantedBy = [ "default.target" ];
     serviceConfig.ExecStart = "${pkgs.bluez}/bin/mpris-proxy";
 };

   Or, starting with Home Manager 21.05, enable the mpris-proxy service.

  System-Wide PulseAudio

    This article or section needs expansion.                                  
    Reason: When setting up pulseaudio systemWide extra policies needs to be  
    deployed for pulse to be able to connect to the bluetooth stack. The Info 
    below is not enough. (Discuss in Talk:Bluetooth#)                         
    Please consult the pedia article metapage for guidelines on contributing. 

   When you are running PulseAudio system-wide then you will need to add the
   following modules to your default.pa configuration:

 hardware.pulseaudio.configFile = pkgs.writeText "default.pa" ''
   load-module module-bluetooth-policy
   load-module module-bluetooth-discover
   ## module fails to load with
   ##   module-bluez5-device.c: Failed to get device path from module arguments
   ##   module.c: Failed to load module "module-bluez5-device" (argument: ""): initialization failed.
   # load-module module-bluez5-device
   # load-module module-bluez5-discover
 '';

  Enabling extra codecs

   While pulseaudio itself only has support for the SBC bluetooth codec there
   is out-of-tree support for AAC, APTX, APTX-HD and LDAC.

   To enable extra codecs add the following to /etc/nixos/configuration.nix:

 {
 ...
   hardware.pulseaudio = {
     enable = true;
     package = pkgs.pulseaudioFull;
   };
 ...
 }

  Enabling A2DP Sink

   Modern headsets will generally try to connect using the A2DP profile. To
   enable this for your bluetooth connection, add the following to
   /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 {
   hardware.bluetooth.settings = {
     General = {
       Enable = "Source,Sink,Media,Socket";
     };
   };
 }

   This configuration may be unnecessary and does not work with bluez5
   (Unknown key Enable for group General ).

  Managing audio devices

   pavucontrol can be used to reconfigure the device:

     * To enable A2DP, change the profile to “High Fidelity Playback (A2DP
       Sink)” on the “Configuration” tab.
     * To set the device as the default audio output, select “set as
       fallback” on the “Output Devices” tab.

   Alternatively, the device can be configured via the command line:

     * To enable A2DP, run:

 $ pacmd set-card-profile "$(pactl list cards short | egrep -o bluez_card[[:alnum:]._]+)" a2dp_sink

     * To set the device as the default audio output, run:

 $ pacmd set-default-sink "$(pactl list sinks short | egrep -o bluez_sink[[:alnum:]._]+)"

   You can also set pulseaudio to automatically switch audio to the connected
   bluetooth device when it connects, in order to do this add the following
   entry into the pulseaudio config

 {
 ...
 hardware.pulseaudio.extraConfig = "
   load-module module-switch-on-connect
 ";
 ...
 }

   Note that you may need to clear the pulseaudio config located at
   ~/.config/pulse to get this to work. Also you may have to unset and then
   set the default audio device to the bluetooth device, see
   https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/86441 for more info

Showing battery charge of bluetooth devices

   If you want to see what charge your bluetooth devices have you have to
   enable experimental features, which might lead to bugs (according to
   [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Bluetooth_headset#Battery_level_reporting
   Arch Wiki). You can add the following to your config to enable
   experimental feature for bluetooth:

 {
 ...
 hardware.bluetooth.settings = {
         General = {
                 Experimental = true;
         };
 };
 ...
 }

   Afterwards rebuild your system and then restart your bluetooth service by
   executing

 $ systemctl restart bluetooth

   .

Troubleshooting

  USB device needs to be unplugged/re-plugged after suspend

   Some USB device/host combinations don't play well with the suspend/resume
   cycle, and need to be unplugged and then re-plugged to work again.

   It is possible to simulate a unplug/re-plug cycle using the /sys
   filesystem.

   This gist provides a script and instructions to set-up a workaround for
   these devices.

  When connecting to an audio device: Failed to connect: org.bluez.Error.Failed

   You need to use pulseaudioFull, see #Using Bluetooth headsets with
   PulseAudio.

  Bluetooth fails to power on with Failed to set power on:
  org.bluez.Error.Blocked

   If journalctl -eu bluetooth shows Failed to set mode: Blocked through
   rfkill (0x12), rfkill might be blocking it:

 $ rfkill
 ID TYPE      DEVICE      SOFT      HARD
  1 wlan      phy0   unblocked unblocked
 37 bluetooth hci0   blocked unblocked

   Unblock it first:

 $ sudo rfkill unblock bluetooth

  Cannot use bluetooth while it previously worked

   Symptoms:

     * When using bluetoothctl, getting "No agent is registered".
     * When using blueman or anything using dbus to talk to bluez, getting
       dbus.exceptions.DBusException:
       org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.AccessDenied: Rejected send message"

   This possibly can be fixed by restarting the display-manager session. The
   session management may have had an issue with registering your current
   session and doesn't allow you to control bluetooth.

 $ sudo systemctl restart display-manager.service

  No audio when using headset in HSP/HFP mode

   If the output of dmesg | grep Bluetooth shows a line similar to Bluetooth:
   hci0: BCM: Patch brcm/BCM-0a5c-6410.hcd not found then your machine uses a
   Broadcom chipset without the required firmware installed.

   To fix this, add hardware.enableAllFirmware = true; to your
   /etc/nixos/configuration.nix then reboot.
