   The Budgie Desktop is a feature-rich, modern desktop designed to keep out
   the way of the user.

Installing Budgie Desktop

   To use the Budgie Desktop, add this to your configuration.nix:

 services.xserver.enable = true;
 services.xserver.desktopManager.budgie.enable = true;
 services.xserver.displayManager.lightdm.enable = true;

Excluding some Budgie Desktop applications from the default install

   Not all applications that come pre-installed with the Budgie Desktop are
   desirable for everyone to have on their machines. There's a way to edit
   configuration.nix to exclude these kinds of packages, for example as
   follows:

 environment.budgie.excludePackages = with pkgs; [
   mate.mate-terminal
   vlc
 ];
