   From NixOS Wiki

   Nixpkgs hosts a number of simple functions called "build helpers", that
   are commonly used as part of a larger derivation, such as
   stdenv.mkDerivation. These helpers can be used part of a larger
   derivation, or to produce a simple derivation that doesn't need the full
   power of the standard environment.

     Reason: Doesn't cover all builders, see:

    runCommandWith

   An extremely simple derivation that runs a series of shell commands as
   part of the build-step. It would be accurate to consider this as a fancy
   wrapper around installPhase.

   This function accepts two arguments, an attribute set and a string. The
   attribute set is defined as:

    1. name: The derivation name, exactly like a standard Nix derivation.
    2. stdenv (default: pkgs.stdenv): Define the standard environment used
    3. runLocal (default: false): Prevents the usage of substituters and/or
       remote builders; forces local builds only.
    4. derivationArgs (default: {}): Additional arguments passed directly
       into an internal mkDerivation.

   The string represents a series of shell commands to execute when building
   this derivation. These must generate an $out, much like a standard
   derivation.

   A common use case for this type of builder is when you're copying files
   into the store. You can get quite creative and use this to transform those
   files as they become part of the store, leaving you with the final,
   transformed file output.

 {
   runCommandWith,
   sassc,
 }:
 runCommandWith {
   name = "sass-to-css";
   derivationArgs.nativeBuildInputs = [ sassc ];
 } ''
   mkdir -p $out
   sassc ${./style.scss} $out/style.css
 ''

   Nixpkgs provides a few higher-level entry points for this builder. All of
   these functions accept a name, and an attribute set that maps to
   derivationArgs for the above. This simpler signature makes them more
   suitable for use as compared to runCommandWith, and should be preferred
   unless you know you need runCommandWith directly.

     * runCommand: sets stdenv = pkgs.stdenvNoCC.
     * runCommandCC: completely default runCommandWith.
     * runCommandLocal: sets runLocal = true.

   There are a couple other aliases that aren't used very often, but will be
   listed here anyways as an exhaustive reference:

     * runCommandNoCC: identical to runCommand.
     * runCommandNoCCLocal: identical to runCommandLocal.
