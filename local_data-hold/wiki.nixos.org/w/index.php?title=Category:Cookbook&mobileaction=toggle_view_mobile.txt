   From NixOS Wiki

   Cookbook is one of the five primary resource categories for the wiki.

   Cookbooks are collections of recipes. The recipes it contains will provide
   instructions on how to get a solution for a certain subject. They are goal
   oriented and have a clear beginning and end. They show someone - who can
   be assumed to have some basic knowledge already - how to achieve
   something.

   Cookbooks are different from Tutorials as they provide answers to a
   question that a true beginner might not even be able to formulate.

   They are arranged by theme / tool into separate articles.

  Comparison to other resource page types

     * If information is more encyclopedic (with a similar scope and tone to
       pages on Wikipedia), a page would be considered a pedia.
     * If information is less encyclopedic and more similar to a compendium,
       study guide, or a bibliographic guide, a page would be considered a
       guide.
     * If information is more about direct instruction to achieve a specific
       task, a page would be considered a tutorial.
     * If a page is more just a set of tips and tricks (less instructive than
       a tutorial), it would be a cookbook.
     * If a page is a detailed reference (like a man page or full software
       manual), it would fit under references.
