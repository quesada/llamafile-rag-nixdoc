   NixOS is a good Linux distribution for gaming. But it also has some
   difficulties because most self downloaded programs will not run without a
   little additional configuration like running it with steam-run.

   With a simple module like this its possible to install the programs needed
   for gaming.

 { pkgs, config, ... }:
 {
   imports = [
   ];

   options = {
   };

   config = {
     programs.gamemode.enable = true; # for performance mode

     programs.steam = {
       enable = true; # install steam
       remotePlay.openFirewall = true; # Open ports in the firewall for Steam Remote Play
       dedicatedServer.openFirewall = true; # Open ports in the firewall for Source Dedicated Server
     };

     environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
       heroic # install heroic launcher
       lutris # install lutris launcher
       mumble # install voice-chat
       protonup-qt # GUI for installing custom Proton versions like GE_Proton
       (retroarch.override {
         cores = with libretro; [ # decide what emulators you want to include
           puae # Amiga 500
           scummvm
           dosbox
         ];
       })
       teamspeak_client # install voice-chat
     ];
   };
 }
