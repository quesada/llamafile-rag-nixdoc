   From NixOS Wiki

   Guide is one of the five primary resource categories for the wiki.

  Guide scope

   Guide can mean many things. In our case, we look at guides as a sort of
   reference work. To understand what pages might be considered guides, look
   to these sources in particular:

    1. Compendium - "... a concise collection of information pertaining to a
       body of knowledge. A compendium may summarize a larger work."
    2. Study guide - "Study guides can be broad based to facilitate learning
       in a number of areas, or be resources that foster comprehension...
       Some will summarize ... the important elements of the subject."
    3. Guide to information sources - "... (or a bibliographic guide, a
       literature guide, a guide to reference materials, a subject gateway,
       etc.) is a kind of metabibliography. Ideally it is not just a listing
       of bibliographies, reference works and other information sources, but
       more like a textbook introducing users to the information sources in a
       given field (in general)."

  Comparison to other resource page types

     * If information is more encyclopedic (with a similar scope and tone to
       pages on Wikipedia), a page would be considered a pedia.
     * If information is less encyclopedic and more similar to a compendium,
       study guide, or a bibliographic guide, a page would be considered a
       guide.
     * If information is more about direct instruction to achieve a specific
       task, a page would be considered a tutorial.
     * If a page is more just a set of tips and tricks (less instructive than
       a tutorial), it would be a cookbook.
     * If a page is a detailed reference (like a man page or full software
       manual), it would fit under references.
