   Pedia is one of the five primary resource categories for the wiki.

   Pedias (abbreviation of "encyclopedia") are understanding-oriented
   articles aimed at explaining a particular topic. They are encyclopedic,
   intended to provide an overview of the subject at hand and various
   perspectives of it. A pedia article might be read casually for leisure,
   rather than being used as reference while coding.

  Writing Pedias

   Besides the general style considerations, pedia articles should value:

   Overview
           Pedias are meant to provide a clear overview of their subject
           matter, and be accordingly organized into easily navigable
           sections.

   Diversity
           Pedias should cover multiple workflows, approaches and
           perspectives to the topic.

   Focus
           Pedias should maintain focus on the subject at hand, linking to
           other resources such as dedicated articles when a section starts
           running too long.

   While in general, pedia articles can take a wide variety of forms, the
   following canonical form is designed for articles covering a software
   package, application or libraries, and will often be applicable in the
   NixOS Wiki:

    1. Introduction: a general overview.
    2. Usage: a practical overview of different approaches to installing,
       configuring and operating the software, linking to more comprehensive
       guides.
    3. Internals: a theoretical overview of the internal architecture of the
       software, including critical files and directories, processes and
       objects.
    4. Development: a project overview for potential contributors, including
       an overview of the source-code directory structure, development
       process, issue tracking and the developer community.
    5. History: a historical overview of the software, including an overview
       of the origins and past development of the software, and the broader
       historical context, such as precedents and antecedents.

  Comparison to other resource page types

     * If information is less encyclopedic and more similar to a compendium,
       study guide, or a bibliographic guide, a page would be considered a
       guide.
     * If information is more about direct instruction to achieve a specific
       task, a page would be considered a tutorial.
     * If a page is more just a set of tips and tricks (less instructive than
       a tutorial), it would be a cookbook.
     * If a page is a detailed reference (like a man page or full software
       manual), it would fit under references.
