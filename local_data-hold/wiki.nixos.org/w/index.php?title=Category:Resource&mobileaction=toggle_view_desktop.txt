   From NixOS Wiki

   This is a container category for the five main resource categories on the
   wiki.

Guide scopes

     * If information is more encyclopedic (with a similar scope and tone to
       pages on Wikipedia), a page would be considered a pedia.
     * If information is less encyclopedic and more similar to a compendium,
       study guide, or a bibliographic guide, a page would be considered a
       guide.
     * If information is more about direct instruction to achieve a specific
       task, a page would be considered a tutorial.
     * If a page is more just a set of tips and tricks (less instructive than
       a tutorial), it would be a cookbook.
     * If a page is a detailed reference (like a man page or full software
       manual), it would fit under references.
