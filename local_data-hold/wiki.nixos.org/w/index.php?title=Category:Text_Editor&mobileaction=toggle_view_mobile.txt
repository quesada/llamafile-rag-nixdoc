   From NixOS Wiki

   Text editors are available for the command line as well as graphical
   programs for the desktop environment. On the command line, three lines of
   text editors are well-known:

     * GNU nano
     * GNU emacs
     * vi, which has evolved through vim, neovim with its various
       distributions, and now also Kakoune and Helix. The latter two have
       partially reversed the keybindings.

   These factors, along with the different programming languages for
   configuration, varying default settings, and plugin ecosystems, make the
   choice of a text editor more significant and long-lasting than it might
   initially appear.
