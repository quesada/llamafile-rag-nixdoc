   Nixpkgs is the Git repository containing all package recipes and NixOS
   module declarations. Installing packages directly from the master branch
   of the Nixpkgs repository is possible but risky, since Git commits are
   merged into master before being heavily tested. That is where channel
   branches are useful.

   A "channel branch" is Git branch with the "verified" Git commits in
   Nixpkgs that is exposed at channels.nixos.org. There is also a channel
   status webpage that tracks the age of channel branches.

   Each channel branch follows a corresponding development branch to which
   new commits are first added. These new commits are then "verified" using
   the Hydra continuous integration system, where each channel branch
   corresponds to building any new or updated packages for that branch and
   perform the associated tests. A channel branch is updated once its builds
   succeeds for a new commit. Contrary to users of the development branches,
   channel branch users will benefit from both "verified" commits and
   pre-built packages from the public binary cache.

   There are several types of channel branches, each with its own use case
   and verification phase.

The official channels

   Channels can be broadly categorized into stable and unstable channels, and
   large and small channels:

     * Stable/unstable:
          * Stable channels (nixos-24.05) only provide conservative updates
            for fixing bugs and security vulnerabilities, but do not receive
            major updates after the initial release. New stable channels are
            released every six months.
          * Unstable channels (nixos-unstable, nixpkgs-unstable) follow the
            master branch of Nixpkgs, delivering the latest tested updates on
            a rolling basis.
     * Large/small:
          * Large channels (nixos-24.05, nixos-unstable) are updated only
            after Hydra has finished building the full breadth of Nixpkgs.
          * Small channels (nixos-24.05-small, nixos-unstable-small) are
            identical to large channels, but are updated as soon as Hydra has
            finished building a defined set of commonly-used packages. Thus,
            users following these channels will get faster updates but may
            need to build any packages they use from outside the defined set
            themselves. These channels are intended to be used for server
            setups, for example.

   Most users will want the stable/large channel, currently nixos-24.05.

   NixOS uses Nix profiles for the root user to refer different versions of
   the system-wide configuration. Profiles set for other users only control
   the user environment for that user.

Channel update process

   The channel update process begins when anyone with commit access pushes
   changes to either master or one of the release-XX.XX branches.

  Hydra Build

   Then, for each unstable channel (see above), a particular job at
   hydra.nixos.org is started which must succeed:

     * For NixOS: the trunk-combined/tested job, which includes some
       automated NixOS tests.
     * For nixos-small: the unstable-small/tested job.
     * For nixpkgs: the trunk/unstable job, which contains some critical
       release packages.

  Success Conditions

   For a channel update to succeed, two conditions need to be satisfied:

     * Particular jobset evaluation needs to be completely built ie. no more
       queued jobs, even if some jobs may fail
     * Particular jobset evaluation's tested/unstable job needs to be built
       succesfully

   The nixos.org server has a cronjob for which nixos-channel-scripts are
   executed and poll for the newest jobset that satisfies the above two
   conditions and trigger a channel update.

  Channel Update

   Once the job succeeds at a particular nixpkgs commit, cache.nixos.org will
   download binaries from hydra.nixos.org. When the download completes, the
   channel updates.

   For the NixOS channel command-not-found index is generated, which can take
   some time since it has to fetch all packages. nixpkgs is quickly updated
   since none of the above needs to happen once a channel update is
   triggered.

   Updates for the -unstable channels typically take a few days after commits
   land in the master branch.

   To find out when a channel was last updated, check
   https://status.nixos.org/. The progress of a particular pull request can
   be tracked via the (third-party) Nixpkgs Pull Request Tracker.

When unstable lags behind master

   As https://status.nixos.org shows, a downside of nixos-unstable is that
   when the channel is blocked due to hydra failures, other (security) fixes
   will also not get in. While of course we try to keep hydra green, it is
   expected that this happens every once in a while. When you want to upgrade
   or downgrade a single package while leaving the rest of your system on
   nixos-unstable, you could use this approach.

Check build status

   hydra-check

 $ hydra-check --channel unstable bash
 Build Status for nixpkgs.bash.x86_64-linux on unstable
 ✔ bash-4.4-p23 from 2021-05-23 - https://hydra.nixos.org/build/143785213

   also useful for finding build logs
