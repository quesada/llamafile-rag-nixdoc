Installation

  NixOS

   Add chromium to systemPackages.

Accelerated video playback

   Make sure Accelerated Video Playback is setup on the system properly.
   Check chrome://gpu to see if Chromium has enabled hardware acceleration.

   If accelerated video playback is not working, check relevant flags at
   chrome://flags, or enable them using the cli:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 {
   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     (chromium.override {
       commandLineArgs = [
         "--enable-features=VaapiVideoDecodeLinuxGL"
         "--ignore-gpu-blocklist"
         "--enable-zero-copy"
       ];
     })
   ];
 }

Enabling native Wayland support

   You can turn on native Wayland support in all chrome and most electron
   apps by setting an environment variable:
   environment.sessionVariables.NIXOS_OZONE_WL = "1".

Enabling DRM (Widevine support)

   By default, chromium does not support playing DRM protected media.
   However, there is a build time flag to include the unfree Widevine blob
   from nixpkgs:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 {
   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     (chromium.override { enableWideVine = true; })
   ];
 }
