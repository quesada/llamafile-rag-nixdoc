   instructions to configure chrony as an NTP server)

   Chrony is an NTP and NTS client and server implementation. This means it
   can synchronize the time of your local machine, as well as provide
   services to clients on the attached network segments.

NTP

   This protocol is slowly being phased out due it security concerns, using a
   more secure method like NTS is recommended. To enable NTP, enable the
   chrony service and add whichever NTP servers you wish to use. If you don't
   set a serverlist here, the value of networking.timeServers will be used.

 { config
 , ...
 };
 {
   services.chrony = {
     enable = true;
     servers = [ "ntp-example.com" ];
   };
 }

NTS

   To enable NTS (Network Time Security), typically all that needs to be
   provided is a NTP server capable of NTS.

 { config
 , ...
 };
 {
   services.chrony = {
     enable = true;
     enableNTS = true;
     servers = [ "nts-example.com" ];
   };
 }

   You can verify that NTS is being used via observing the output of sudo
   chronyc -N authdata and reading the value under mode, it should read NTS.

   This will not work with the default timeservers of NixOS, as they do not
   support NTS!

  Troubleshooting

   It is possible that a certificate may need to be manually provided. You
   can rely on the ACME service to acquire one, but make sure that the
   certificate group gets assigned to chrony, or else the service will not be
   able to read the certificate and key after it drops its privileges.

 { config
 , ...
 };
 let
   acmePath = config.security.acme.certs."foo-example.com".directory;
 in
 {
   security.acme.certs."foo-example.com" = {
     group = "chrony";
     # One of the following challenge method options will need to be provided
     # to obtain a self signed cert
     webroot = "";
     s3bucket = '"";
     dnsProvider = "";
     listenHTTP = "";
   };

    services.chrony = {
      enable = true;
      enableNTS = true;
      extraConfig = ''
       [...]
       ntsservercert ${acmePath}/fullchain.pem
       ntsserverkey ${acmePath}/key.pem
     '';
   };
 }

Hosting an NTP server

   The simplest config to make chrony act as an NTP server is this
   configuration:

 { ... }:
 {
   services.chrony = {
     enable = true;
     extraConfig = ''
       allow
     '';
   };

   networking.firewall.allowedUDPPorts = [ 123 ];
 }

   This allows any external client to request time via NTP. You can also
   limit the allowed clients to certain subnets like so:

 { ... }:
 {
   services.chrony = {
     enable = true;
     extraConfig = ''
       allow 10.100.0.0/24
       allow 192.168.178.0/24
     '';
   };

   networking.firewall.allowedUDPPorts = [ 123 ];
 }

  NTS while hosting

   If you want to enable NTS, you need to also add
   networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts = [ 4460 ]; as this port is used for
   the NTS key-exchange before the encrypted connection via port 123.

   Currently (as of NixOS 24.05), enableNTS is an all-or-nothing setting; it
   will require all servers to support NTS as well as all clients. If you
   need more granularity, use extraConfigand refer to the chrony
   documentation.
