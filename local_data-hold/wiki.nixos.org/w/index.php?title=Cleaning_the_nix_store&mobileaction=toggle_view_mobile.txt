   Sometimes your store fills up the disk, but a simple

 nix-store --gc

   does not seem to clean all that much.

   This usually means that you have some old collection roots that keep old
   versions of nixpkgs around.

   Sometimes result files created by an ad-hoc nix-build bind a lot of
   resources, these can be found by running:

 nix-store --gc --print-roots | egrep -v "^(/nix/var|/run/\w+-system|\{memory|/proc)"

   Additional Resources about cleaning up the nix-store:

   There are multiple tools that can help with discovering gcroots and
   calculate the disk size:
