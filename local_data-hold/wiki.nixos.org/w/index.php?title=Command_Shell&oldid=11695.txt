   A shell is a program that translates text commands (like ls, vim, reboot
   etc) into instructions for your computer. The default shell on NixOS is
   bash, but it can be easily changed.

   Note: Zsh is used here as an example. You can use other shells, e.g. fish
   or nushell.

Enable

   When adding a new shell, always enable the shell system-wide, even if it's
   already enabled in your Home Manager configuration, otherwise it won't
   source the necessary files.

   For example, for Zsh:

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 programs.zsh.enable = true;

Changing the default shell

  For all users

   To set a command shell as the default for all users, use the
   defaultUserShell option.

   For example, to set Zsh as the default user shell for all users:

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 users.defaultUserShell = pkgs.zsh;

  For a specific user

   To set a command shell as the default for a particular user, use the
   <name>.shell option.

   For example, to set user "myuser"'s shell to fish:

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 users.users.myuser.shell = pkgs.fish;

   You can also choose whether or not a user should use the default shell:

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 users.users.myuser.useDefaultShell = true;
