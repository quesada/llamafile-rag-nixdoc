Introduction

   Sometimes you need to use secrets in your system configuration. Those can
   range from user passwords and Wifi passwords over private keys (ssh, ssl,
   ...) to API tokens and similar things. Normally one would store this kind
   of information in files with restricted access rights (only readable by
   some Unix user) or even encrypt them on disk. Nix and NixOS store a lot of
   information in the world-readable Nix store where at least the former is
   not possible. People who track their configuration with Git (or use
   Flakes) might even want to store these secrets in the Git repository but
   still upload the repository somewhere.

   In these cases it is necessary to think about a suitable scheme to manage
   the relevant secrets so that they are only readable by the right people or
   machines. This page tries to give an overview of different schemes that
   can be used and outlines the aims, requirements and implications of each.

   This page was created from a discussion on Discourse and is likely never
   complete as people will start new projects to handle secrets in Nix(OS).

Definitions

   The properties of the different schemes that are listed in the table below
   are explained in detail here. You are welcome to add more schemes (rows)
   to the table; please try to fill in as many of the properties as you can.
   If you add a new column please try to fill it for all existing rows as
   much as possible.

   scheme
           the name of the scheme, if possible a link to the official website
           or source, maybe a short description

   pre build
           Where does the secret reside before the configuration is build? In
           a file, in a nix expression, in an external database (password
           manager)? Is it encrypted?

   build time
           what happens at build time, is the secret decrypted or encrypted,
           which master passwords, passphrases or helper programs are needed

   in the store (on disk)
           Is the data stored in /nix/store after the build? Is it encrypted.
           This has implications for reproducability. If a secret is not
           stored in the nix store it might be more difficult to recreate an
           old system configuration

   system activation
           what happens to the data at system activation, that is at boot
           time or when nixos-rebuild switch or --rollback is executed

   runtime
           where does the secret reside after system activation, is it
           encrypted, who can read it

   encryption technology
           which programs or tools are used for encryption or decryption of
           secrets; whether ssh-agent, gpg-agent or similar are supported

   "official" project
           whether this is a published software project (maybe even actively
           developed) or just some notes in a forum or a blog entry
