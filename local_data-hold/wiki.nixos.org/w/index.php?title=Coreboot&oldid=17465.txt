Building as Nix Derivation

   There is a commented example of building Coreboot as Nix derivation at
   blitz/nix-coreboot on Github.

Building in nix-shell

   Note: the following was tested and working on NixOS 21.11 (Porcupine)
   while compiling the QEMU target for Coreboot v4.15 as well as Coreboot
   master (7b168c92f6).

   To build your own coreboot bios:

   Create a shell.nix, and run nix-shell

 # shell.nix

 # NOTE we need mkShellNoCC
 # mkShell would add the regular gcc, which has no ada (gnat)
 # https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/142943

 with import <nixpkgs> { };
 mkShellNoCC {
   buildInputs = [
     gnat11 # gcc with ada
     #gnatboot # gnat1
     ncurses # make menuconfig
     m4 flex bison # Generate flashmap descriptor parser
     #clang
     zlib
     #acpica-tools # iasl
     pkgconfig
     qemu # test the image
   ];
   shellHook = ''
     # TODO remove?
     NIX_LDFLAGS="$NIX_LDFLAGS -lncurses"
   '';
 }

   Now we can build coreboot:

 # clone coreboot git repository (latest master)
 git clone https://review.coreboot.org/coreboot.git --depth 1
 # or for a specific coreboot version (I.E. version 4.15)
 git clone --branch 4.15 https://review.coreboot.org/coreboot.git --depth 1

 # get 3rd party submodules in coreboot repository
 cd coreboot
 du -sh . # ~200 MByte
 git submodule update --init --checkout --depth 1
 du -sh . # ~700 MByte

 # configure
 # set mainboard model, chip size, ...
 make menuconfig MENUCONFIG_COLOR=blackbg # blackbg = dark mode

 # build toolchain for a x86 target
 # Note: the i386 toolchain is used for all x86 platforms including x86_64.
 # See https://doc.coreboot.org/tutorial/part1.html
 # to list all targets: make help
 make crossgcc-i386 CPUS=$(nproc)

 # build firmware
 make CPUS=$(nproc)

 # test firmware
 qemu-system-x86_64 -bios build/coreboot.rom -serial stdio

Skip building toolchain

   We can use our system toolchain to build coreboot firmware, but this is
   not recommended per coreboot docs:

     you can possibly use your system toolchain, but the results are not
     reproducible, and may have issues, so this is not recommended

   To use the system toolchain, in make menuconfig, enable General Setup >
   Allow building with any toolchain

Building as derivation

   coreboot is pretty picky about the toolchain it is built with and thus
   using the toolchain it comes with is the easiest path to success. There
   are commented Nix expressions that build coreboot here.
