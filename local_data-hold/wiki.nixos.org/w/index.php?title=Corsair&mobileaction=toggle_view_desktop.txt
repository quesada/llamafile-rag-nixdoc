   From NixOS Wiki

   CORSAIR is an American computer peripherals and gaming brand.

   Its possible to configure its keyboards and mice with an open source
   driver: ckb-next

Example config for ckb-next

 # /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
 { config, pkgs, ... }:

 {
   # ...
   hardware.ckb-next.enable = true;
 }

   Seehardware.ckb-nextfor more configuration options.

Limitations

   Doing the above will enable the background service and install ckb-next.
   Yet (as of writing) you still have to manually run/open ckb-next on launch
   before it works.

   If you find a way to automate this, please append to the wiki!
