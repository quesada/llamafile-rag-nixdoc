    This article or section needs expansion.                                  
    Reason: This article is a stub. (Discuss in Talk:Craft CMS#)              
    Please consult the pedia article metapage for guidelines on contributing. 

   There is (as of writing) no built-in service for Craft CMS. However, this
   can be built around with Docker! The following instructions are based on
   the Docker instructions on the Craft CMS website and experimentation.

Setup through Docker

    1. Install Craft CMS

 # From https://craftcms.com/knowledge-base/docker-for-local-development

 # Create and move into a new directory:
 mkdir craft-docker
 cd craft-docker

 # Bootstrap a new Craft installation with Composer:
 docker run \
   --rm \
   --volume $PWD:/app \
   composer \
   composer create-project craftcms/craft . --ignore-platform-reqs

    2. Create docker-compose.yml

 # /home/username/craftcms/docker-compose.yml
 services:
   web:
     image: docker.io/craftcms/nginx:8.2
     ports:
       - "4004:8080"
     volumes:
       - /home/username/craft-docker/:/app  # Craft CMS installation
     environment:
       - CRAFT_DB_DRIVER=pgsql
       - CRAFT_DB_SERVER=db
       - CRAFT_DB_PORT=5432
       - CRAFT_DB_DATABASE=db
       - CRAFT_DB_USER=db
       - CRAFT_DB_PASSWORD=RANDOM
       - CRAFT_DB_SCHEMA=public
       - CRAFT_DB_TABLE_PREFIX=
    
     depends_on:
       db:
         condition: service_healthy
  
   db:
     image: docker.io/postgres:13-alpine
     expose:
       - 5432
     healthcheck:
       test: ["CMD", "pg_isready", "-U", "db", "-d", "db"]
       interval: 5s
       retries: 3
     environment:
       POSTGRES_DB: db
       POSTGRES_USER: db
       POSTGRES_PASSWORD: RANDOM
     volumes:
       - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

 volumes:
   db_data:

    3. Modify your NixOS setup along the following lines:

 # /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
 { config, pkgs, ... }:

 {
   virtualisation.docker.enable = true;

   systemd.services.craftcms = {
     script = "${pkgs.docker-compose}/bin/docker-compose up --force-recreate";
     serviceConfig.WorkingDirectory = "/home/username/craftcms/";  # Point to directory with docker-compose.yml
     # path = with pkgs; [ docker ];  # Uncomment in case docker executable is not found
     wantedBy = ["multi-user.target"];
     after = ["docker.service" "docker.socket"];
   };
 }

    4. Expose 127.0.0.1:4004 so it can be reached by other devices, and
       navigate to example.com/index.php?p=admin/install (replacing
       example.com with your domain or ip:port)
