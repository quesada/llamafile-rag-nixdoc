   Crater is a web application for managing invoices, clients and payments.

Installation

   Note: Parts of this instruction and module are not yet stable and will be
   available in the upcoming NixOS 23.05 release.

   To setup Crater locally, this is the most minimal configuration to get
   started

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.crater.enable = true;

   After that Crater will be available at http://localhost . Complete the
   setup by choosing your default language and setting up your user profile.
