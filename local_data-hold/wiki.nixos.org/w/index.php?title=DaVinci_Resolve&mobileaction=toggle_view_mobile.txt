   From NixOS Wiki

   DaVinci Resolve color grading, color correction, visual effects, and audio
   post-production video editing application. It is unfree and
   multi-plattform.

Installation

   Install the davinci-resolve package.

Drivers

  AMD

   Contrary to the Arch Wiki, DaVinci Resolve seems to work (on an RX 570)
   without switching to proprietary GPU drivers.

 hardware.amdgpu.opencl.enable = true;

  Intel

   DaVinci Resolve has partial support for Intel GPUs on Linux. Audio
   playback works on the Fairlight page, but the video timeline does not
   work. To add Intel support, add the following setting to your
   configuration.nix:

  hardware.graphics = { # hardware.opengl in 24.05
     enable = true;
     enable32Bit = true; # driSupport32Bit in 24.05
     extraPackages = with pkgs; [
       intel-compute-runtime
     ];
   };

Troubleshooting

  Resolve crashes/fails to start

   If it doesn't launch, and crashes when running davinci-resolve, then try
   running it as root.

   If it didn't help, you can view the error log at
   ~/.local/share/DaVinciResolve/logs/ResolveDebug.txt to pinpoint the issue.

   If you can spot a line similar to Cannot mix incompatible Qt library
   (5.15.12) with this library (5.15.2), and have configured QT options in
   your NixOS configuration (qt.enable = true;), try disabling them.

  Cannot import video file

   DaVinci Resolve's free edition does not come with H264/H265 support. You
   need to convert your video to a supported video format, like DNxHD/DNxHR
   and Cineform. you can do this with ffmpeg. With FFmpeg installed, assuming
   your video is called video.mp4, you can use the following command to
   convert:

   ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v dnxhd -profile:v dnxhr_hq -c:a pcm_s16le -pix_fmt
   yuv422p output.mov

   This command will convert your video to a DNxHR video and your audio to
   uncompressed 16bit PCM. For 24bit PCM, use -c:a pcm_s24le instead.

   You can know more about DNxHD/HR profiles with the command ffmpeg -h
   encoder=dnxhd

   Resolve also supports Cineform and a few other formats. For Cineform
   encoding, use the cfhd encoder.
