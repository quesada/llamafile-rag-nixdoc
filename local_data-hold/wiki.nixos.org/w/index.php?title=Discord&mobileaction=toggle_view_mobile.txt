   From NixOS Wiki

   Discord is an instant messaging and VoIP application with lots of
   functionality. It provides a web interface, though most users would prefer
   to use a client for interoperability with their system.

Installation

   Note: This package is unfree and requires extra steps to install.

  Official Clients

   Nixpkgs provides all three of Discord's release channels, accessible as
   pkgs.discord, pkgs.discord-ptb, and pkgs.discord-canary respectively. Add
   any of the previous derivations to your package's configuration. For NixOS
   this will be in environment.systemPackages or users.users.<name>.packages.

 # configuration.nix
 { config, lib, pkgs, ... }: {
   # This will install Discord PTB for all users of the system
   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     discord-ptb
   ];

   # This installs Discord PTB only for the user "alice"
   users.users.alice.packages = with pkgs; [
     discord-ptb
   ];
 }

  Unofficial Clients

   Nixpkgs also provides a vast variety of community developed/modded Discord
   clients, which can usually serve as drop-in replacements for the official
   discord client with an extended set of features.

   Warning: The usage of such client's goes against Discord's TOS, and can
   result in your account being permanently suspended from the platform!

    Legcord (formerly ArmCord)^[1]

   Lightweight, alternative desktop client with built-in modding
   extensibility. Nixpkgs provides this client via pkgs.legcord.

 { config, lib, pkgs, ... }: {
   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     legcord
   ];
 }

    BetterDiscord^[2]

   Enhances Discord desktop app with new features. Nixpkgs provides the
   installer via pkgs.betterdiscordctl. This can be added to your
   configuration, though users may prefer to instead run it one-off via the
   Nix cli.

 $ nix-shell -p betterdiscordctl --command 'betterdiscordctl install' # nix-legacy
 $ nix run nixpkgs#betterdiscordctl -- install # nix3

 $ nix-shell -p betterdiscordctl --command 'betterdiscordctl self-upgrade' # nix-legacy
 $ nix run nixpkgs#betterdiscordctl -- self-upgrade # nix3

    OpenAsar^[3]

   Open-source alternative to Discord's app.asar. Nixpkgs provides this via
   pkgs.openasar, though this doesn't provide a usable client. Users should
   instead prefer overriding the official discord package and add
   withOpenASAR = true.

 { config, lib, pkgs, ... }: {
   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     (discord.override {
       withOpenASAR = true;
       # withVencord = true; # can do this here too
     })
   ];
 }

    Vencord^[4]

   The cutest Discord client mod. Nixpkgs provides their custom client
   Vesktop viapkgs.vesktop, or as an override for the official discord
   package via withVencord = true.

 { config, lib, pkgs, ... }: {
   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     # vesktop # If you prefer this

     (discord.override {
       # withOpenASAR = true; # can do this here too
       withVencord = true;
     })
   ];
 }

    Webcord^[5]

   Discord and Spacebar client implemented without using the official Discord
   API. Nixpkgs provides this client via pkgs.webcord.

 { config, lib, pkgs, ... }: {
   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     webcord
   ];
 }

Troubleshooting

  Screensharing on Wayland

   Discord's screen sharing capabilities have been broken for 5 years with no
   official fix. The most consistent fix involves using the web version of
   Discord alongside a browser that supports screen sharing in Wayland, like
   Firefox. Alternatively, you can use an unofficial client like Webcord or
   Vesktop, both of which have fixed this issue in their own ways.

   Note: Remember to configure an XDG Desktop Portal with screen cast
   capabilities!

  Notifications causing crashes

   Discord will crash if there is no compatible notification daemon running.
   This issue is only prevalent in custom desktop environments, such as Sway
   or Hyprland. Comprehensive documentation usually exists for most window
   managers/compositors and can be found on their respective wikis. Nixpkgs
   provides a few standalone notification daemons such as pkgs.dunst and
   pkgs.mako. You may optionally use a notification daemon from a larger DE,
   such as pkgs.lxqt.lxqt-notificationd, however it is unclear how effective
   these will be outside of their normal environment.

 { config, lib, pkgs, ... }: {
   # You will need to add a call for the daemon to actually function.
   # This is usually done within the configuration of your respective WM.
   # See the official wiki/documentation for your WM for more info.
   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     mako
   ];
 }

  "Must be your lucky day" popup

   Although Nixpkgs is usually very fast with updates (if you use
   nixos-unstable), you may still run into this issue intermittently. You may
   override the discord package with a more up-to-date source, or you may
   disable this popup entirely by adding "SKIP_HOST_UPDATE": true to
   ~/.config/discord/settings.json.

    

 ~/.config/discord/settings.json

 {
   "SKIP_HOST_UPDATE": true
 }

  Krisp noise suppression

   The Krisp noise suppression option will not work on NixOS because the
   Discord binary is patched before installation, and there is a DRM-style
   integrity check in the Krisp binary which prevents Krisp from working if
   the Discord binary is modified. See
   https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/195512 for details.

  Text-to-Speech

   TTS is disabled by default; you may enable it via an override:

 (pkgs.discord.override { withTTS = true; })
