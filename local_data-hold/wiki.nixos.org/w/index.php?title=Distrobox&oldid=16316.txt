   different architecture)

   Distrobox offers you to use any linux distribution inside your terminal as
   a simple wrapper for Podman, Docker or Lilipod.

Setup

   Distrobox uses Docker internally to fetch and run system images. Easily
   get started by enabling Podman with Docker-compatibility mode.

 virtualisation.podman = {
   enable = true;
   dockerCompat = true;
 };

 environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.distrobox ];

Usage

   Setup container with latest Arch Linux image

 # distrobox create --name archlinux --init --image archlinux:latest

   Enter Arch Linux container

 # distrobox enter archlinux

   For further usage, please refer to the Distrobox documentation.

Tips and tricks

  Using different architecture

   Following example will run an Ubuntu container with a different
   architecture than the host, in this case arm64.

   Add following line to your system configuration, apply it and then reboot
   the system.

 boot.binfmt.emulatedSystems = [ "aarch64-linux" ];

   Run a Debian container with arm64 architecture

 sudo podman run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
 distrobox create -n debian --image arm64v8/debian
 distrobox enter debian
