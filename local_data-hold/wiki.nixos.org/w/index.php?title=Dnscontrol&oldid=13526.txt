   Dnscontrol is a tool to synchronize your DNS to multiple providers from a
   simple DSL.

Installation

   Install dnscontrol in your current environment

 # nix-env -iA nixos.dnscontrol

Configuration

   In the following example usage, we'll create a credentials file called
   creds.json with the login details for the domain provider Inwx.com:

    

 creds.json

 {
   "inwx": {
     "TYPE": "INWX",
     "username": "myuser",
     "password": "mypassword"
   }
 }

   See upstream documentation for available provider and their authentication
   syntax.

   The second required configuration file called dnsconfig.js defines
   providers and domain configurations. In this example, we'll add a
   subdomain test to the domain example.org with a specific A-record.

    

 dnsconfig.js

 var REG_NONE = NewRegistrar("none");
 var DSP_INWX = NewDnsProvider("inwx");

 D("example.org", REG_NONE, DnsProvider(DSP_INWX), NO_PURGE,
     A("test", "1.2.3.4")
 );

   The provider will be Inwx for which we configured the credentials earlier.
   The option NO_PURGE tells dnscontrol to only add the new record while
   leaving all other entries untouched.

Usage

   Preview the changes which will be made to your domain

 # dnscontrol preview

   Apply changes with the following command

 # dnscontrol push

   Confirm changes to the dns record using the tool dig.

 # nix shell nixpkgs#dnsutils --command dig +short test.example.org
