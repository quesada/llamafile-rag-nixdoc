   doas is a utility to execute commands as a different user, typically the
   super user. It is often installed as a replacement for sudo, due to its
   ease of configuration and greater simplicity. It is not recommended to use
   doas due to compatibility issues with sudo. Flake based configurations
   require git to be installed as a system package in order to rebuild.

Configuration

   The following configuration will give the user foo the ability to execute
   commands as the super user via doas, while disabling the sudo command.

 security.doas.enable = true;
 security.sudo.enable = false;
 security.doas.extraRules = [{
   users = ["foo"];
   # Optional, retains environment variables while running commands
   # e.g. retains your NIX_PATH when applying your config
   keepEnv = true;
   persist = true;  # Optional, don't ask for the password for some time, after a successfully authentication
 }];
