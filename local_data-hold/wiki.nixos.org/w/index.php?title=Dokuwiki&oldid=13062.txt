   DokuWiki is a web application and simple Wiki software for creating
   documentation and editable pages in markdown language. Compared to other
   Wikis, it is more minimal and only depends on PHP and file access without
   any need for databases. It stores all information in plain text files to
   be available even without the DokuWiki software (e.g. to read directly
   from backup).

Installation

   To setup DokuWiki locally, this is the most minimal configuration to get
   started

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.dokuwiki.sites."localhost" = {
   enable = true;
   settings.title = "My Wiki";
 };

   After that DokuWiki will be available at http://localhost .

Configuration

   Besides several options which are exposed by the DokuWiki module in NixOS,
   you can also use settings option to add custom options to your DokuWiki
   configuration. See the upstream documentation for available options.

  Templates

   Unfortunately no templates are packaged yet in nixpkgs. It is possible to
   manually package a template, for example from the official template
   repository, and include it in your Dokuwiki instance. In the following
   example the template mindthedark is packaged and enabled

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 let

   dokuwiki-template-mindthedark = pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation rec {
     name = "mindthedark";
     version = "2021-12-24";
     src = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
       owner = "MrReSc";
       repo = "MindTheDark";
       rev = version;
       sha256 = "sha256-8wWwwAYYQcUYzHpnSKOubZh7UzwfxvWXXNU7CUAiS3o=";
     };
     installPhase = "mkdir -p $out; cp -R * $out/";
   };

 in {
   services.dokuwiki.sites."localhost" = {
     templates = [ dokuwiki-template-mindthedark ];
     settings = {
       template = "mindthedark";
       tpl.mindthedark.autoDark = true;
     };
   };
 };

   Please note that you'll have to manually update the tempalte source and
   checksum in case there's a new version.

  Plugins

   The following example packages the edittable plugin

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 let

   dokuwiki-plugin-edittable = pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
     name = "edittable";
     src = pkgs.fetchzip {
       url = "https://github.com/cosmocode/edittable/archive/master.zip";
       sha256 = "sha256-l+GZdFGp6wyNuCbAZB9IbwpY5c/S4vSW12VP0mJHKXs=";
     };
     sourceRoot = ".";
     installPhase = "mkdir -p $out; cp -R edittable-master/* $out/";
   };

 in {
   services.dokuwiki.sites."localhost" = {
     plugins = [ dokuwiki-plugin-edittable ];
   };
 };

   The plugin is enabled automatically. Note that in case of this plugin, we
   strip the root directory called edittable-master and only copy the plugin
   files to the out-folder. Please note that you'll have to manually update
   the plugin source and checksum in case there's a new version.

  Clean URLs

   If supported by the webserver you've choosen (using the webserver option),
   you can enable clean urls or url rewriting by enabling the option
   userewrite. This means you can access your sites with the simple URL
   scheme like http://localhost/my_project .

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.dokuwiki.sites."localhost".settings = {
   userewrite = true;
 };

   Clean URLs are reported to work with the webserver Caddy.

  Anonymous editing

   To disable the user authentication completely and make the Wiki editable
   by anyone (even anonymous users), you can disable the config useacl with
   the following option

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.dokuwiki.sites."localhost".settings = {
   acluse = false;
 };

Tips and tricks

  SSL behind reverse proxy

   In case you're running DokuWiki behind a reverse proxy which offers
   ssl/https to the outside, you might have to enforce https protocol by
   changing the baseurl

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.dokuwiki.sites."localhost".settings = {
   baseurl = "https://example.org";
 };
