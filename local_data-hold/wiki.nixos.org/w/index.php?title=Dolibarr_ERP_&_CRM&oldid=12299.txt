   Dolibarr ERP CRM is a modern software package to manage your company or
   foundation's activity . Configuration is handled using the
   services.dolibarr. options.

First login for preinstalled installs

   Assuming that myhost.org resolves to the ip address of your host, port 80
   has been opened and /run/keys/dolibarr-db-ini-password contains the
   plain-text password for the dolibarr mysql user.

 services.dolibarr = {
   enable = true;
   domain = "myhost.org";
   preInstalled = true;
   initialDbPasswordFile = "/run/keys/dolibarr-db-ini-password";
 };

   This will configure dolibarr to serve on myhost.org, a prefilled database
   will be provisioned. The following credentials will be configured for the
   dolibarr admin user:

   Login    dolibarrlogin         
   Password 123dolibarrlogin_pass 

   Once you're logged in, please make sure to change those default
   credentials.

First login for manual installs

  Configure the database (unless initialDbPasswordFile)

   If you've provided a non-null value for
   services.dolibarr.initialDbPasswordFile, please skip to the next step.
   Otherwise, you'll have to create the dolibarr user and configure its
   password in mysql before going on. This can simply be done with:

 $ mysql -u root # root is passwordless by default
 MariaDB [(none)]>CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'dolibarr'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password;
 MariaDB [(none)]>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON dolibarr.* TO 'dolibarr'@'localhost';
 MariaDB [(none)]>SET PASSWORD FOR 'dolibarr'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('mytopsecretpassword');

   Note: You should obiously replace mytopsecretpassword with your own
   password.

   Now that the database is configured, we can open dolibarr in the browser.

  Start dolibarr install

   Go to dolibarr's url in the browser with path /install. If we follow the
   previous example, the url should be http://mydolibarurl/install.

    Check page (1st)

   On the check page a form should propose different installation options,
   choose the FreshInstall option at the bottom of the list and click on
   Start.

    Install page (2nd)

   On the install page :

     * set the Directory to store uploaded and generated documents to
       /var/lib/dolibarr/documents (unless you know what you're doing)
     * ensure the Database name is dolibarr
     * ensure the Driver type is mysqli
     * ensure the Database server is localhost
     * ensure the Database port is 3306
     * ensure the Database Login is dolibarr
     * ensure the Database password for dolibarr is the same as the one
       you've configured manually or with
       services.dolibarr.initialDbPasswordFile

    Install step 1 (3rd)

   Nothing to do here, just check that the displayed data is correct and
   continue.

    Install step 2 (4th)

   Again, nothing to do here, just check that the displayed data is correct
   and continue.

    Install step 4 (5th) (no that's not a typo XD)

   Setup your dolibarr admin user's login and password.

    Install step 5 (6th)

   That's it, you're done, dolibarr is installed.

Nixops integration

   If you're willing to deploy dolibarr threw NixOps, you can use its key
   capabilities to delegate the configuration of the database entirely with
   the help of the services.dolibarr.initialDbPasswordFile option. Here is a
   nixops machine configuration:

 {
   deployment = {
     keys.dolibarr-db-ini-password = {
       text = "123dolibarr_pass";
       user = "root";
       group = "root";
       permissions = "0440";
     };
   };

   services.dolibarr = {
     enable = true;
     domain = "146.190.238.159";
     preInstalled = true;
     initialDbPasswordFile = "/run/keys/dolibarr-db-ini-password";
   };
 }

Development

   The services.dolibarr.preInstalled option is made possible by
   automatically filling the install page form and then dumping the dolibarr
   database to a file. The dolibarr nixosTests is made for that (and to test
   if dolibarr still works obviously). To generate a new dump for a
   preinstalled database, just run:

 $ nix-build -A nixosTests.dolibarr
 $ file result/result/dolibarr-db.sql

   The dump file will be stored in ./result/dolibarr-db.sql
