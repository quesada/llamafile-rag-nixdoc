   Dolphin is the KDE desktop's file manager. When using dolphin without KDE,
   you may want to install some optional dependencies.

Troubleshooting

  Wayland

   By default, dolphin by itself is not packaged with wayland support. This
   may cause you to get an error like this:

   qt.qpa.plugin: Could not find the Qt platform plugin "wayland" in ""

   To get wayland support, add the following package:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ kdePackages.qtwayland ];

  Icons

   By default, dolphin by itself is not packaged with support for svg icons.
   This may result in blank icons.

   To fix it, simply add the following package:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ kdePackages.qtsvg ];

  KIO-Fuse

   If you need to mount network shares you can use KIO-Fuse:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     kdePackages.kio-fuse #to mount remote filesystems via FUSE
     kdePackages.kio-extras #extra protocols support (sftp, fish and more)
 ];
