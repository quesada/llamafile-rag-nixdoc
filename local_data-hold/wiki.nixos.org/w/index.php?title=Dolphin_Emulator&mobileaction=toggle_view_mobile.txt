   From NixOS Wiki

   Dolphin is a Nintendo GameCube and Wii emulator, currently supporting the
   x86_64 and AArch64 architectures. Dolphin is available for Linux, macOS,
   Windows, and Android. It is a free and open source, community-developed
   project. Dolphin was the first GameCube and Wii emulator, and currently
   the only one capable of playing commercial games.

Use with controllers

   To use GameCube controllers NixOS udev rules are required.

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 { pkgs, ... }:
 {
   services.udev.packages = [ pkgs.dolphin-emu ];
 }

   To enable GCC to USB adapter overclocking for improved polling rates, use
   the gcadapter-oc-kmod kernel module.

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 { config, ... }:
 {
   boot.extraModulePackages = [
     config.boot.kernelPackages.gcadapter-oc-kmod
   ];

   # to autoload at boot:
   boot.kernelModules = [
     "gcadapter_oc"
   ];
 }
