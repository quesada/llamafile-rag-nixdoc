Troubleshooting

  sievec fails to compile basic sieve scripts in 24.05

   Since NixOS 24.05 even basic sieve commands such as fileinto need to be
   enabled explicitly with:

 services.dovecot2.sieve.globalExtensions = ["fileinto"];

   Otherwise, the sievec command will fail to compile sieve scripts with
   fileinto statements and as a result the Dovecot service itself will fail
   to start if the configuration contains services.dovecot2.sieve.scripts.
