   dwm is a window manager made by the suckless team.

Installation

   Enable dwm in your system configuration:

 services.xserver.windowManager.dwm.enable = true;

Creating an override

  Patching dwm

   To patch dwm, override services.xserver.windowManager.dwm.package as
   below:

 services.xserver.windowManager.dwm.package = pkgs.dwm.override {
   patches = [
     # for local patch files, replace with relative path to patch file
     ./path/to/local.patch
     # for external patches
     (pkgs.fetchpatch {
       # replace with actual URL
       url = "https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/path/to/patch.diff";
       # replace hash with the value from `nix-prefetch-url "https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/path/to/patch.diff" | xargs nix hash to-sri --type sha256`
       # or just leave it blank, rebuild, and use the hash value from the error
       hash = "";
     })
   ];
 };

  Using custom sources

   If you have a locally stored source tree for dwm with changes already
   applied, you can use that instead:

 services.xserver.windowManager.dwm.package = pkgs.dwm.overrideAttrs {
   src = ./path/to/dwm/source/tree;
 };

   Alternatively, you can set src to the output of a fetcher, if you have the
   source tree stored online.

Troubleshooting

   If your change does not appear to take effect:

     * You must not have dwm listed anywhere in your
       environment.systemPackages or home.packages.
     * Remove any packages installed via nix-env or nix profile.
     * After rebuilding and switching, reboot and check again.
