       bytes +397‎ Created page with "[https://ente.io Ente] is a
       self-hostable Google Photos alternative with S3 support and client for
       web and all major platforms. The server API server (museum) and the
       web frontend (ente-web) can be deployed independently and are provided
       as two separate packages in nixpkgs. It is also possible to deploy
       only the API server and use a desktop or mobile client only, the
       frontend is not mandatory."
