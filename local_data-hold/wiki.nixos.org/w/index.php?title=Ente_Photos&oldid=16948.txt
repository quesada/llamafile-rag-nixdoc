   Warning: This page is work-in-progress! Packages and modules for ente are
   still being written. This warning will be removed when they have been
   merged and are ready to use.

   Ente is a self-hostable Google Photos alternative with S3 support and
   client for web and all major platforms.

   The server API server (museum) and the web frontend (ente-web) can be
   deployed independently and are provided as two separate packages in
   nixpkgs. It is also possible to deploy only the API server and use a
   desktop or mobile client only, the frontend is not mandatory.

                                     Setup

   Following configuration will enable a basic API server instance.

 services.museum = {
   enable = true;
   settings = {
   # TODO add example
   };
   credentialsFile = "/path/to/secrets/creds.yaml";
   environmentFile = "/path/to/env";
 };

   To host the web client as well, the files from the frotend package
   (ente-web) can be directly served using a webserver like nginx or caddy.

 services.nginx = {
   enable = true;
   virtualHosts."photos.example.com" = {
     enableACME = true;
     forceSSL = true;
     root = pkgs.ente-web;
   };
 };

                                Tipps and tricks

   The web-client, the desktop-client and the mobile clients (iOS, Android)
   all allow using custom, self-hosted servers. To create an account or log
   into your own server Tap or click the logo in the welcome screen 7 times.
   This will bring up a setting where you can specify a non-official ente API
   server.
