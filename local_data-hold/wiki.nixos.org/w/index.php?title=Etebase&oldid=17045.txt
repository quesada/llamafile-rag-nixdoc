   Etebase is an end-to-end encrypted backend as a service. Think Firebase,
   but encrypted in a way that only your users can access their data.

Example configurations

     * For the server to accept requests from a remote machine
       services.etebase-server.settings.allowed_hosts.allowed_host1 variable
       should be set as the server's subdomain/domain name and your proxy has
       to present a Host header.
     * The django secret key is preferably a randomly generated key, the use
       of a secret managing scheme might prove useful. see
       Comparison_of_secret_managing_schemes.
     * services.etebase-server.global.secret_file needs to be writeable by
       configured services.etebase-server.user. If you're experiencing errors
       on initial setup, make sure there is no file at the filepath so that
       Etebase can generate it

  Nginx example

   This is a basic configuration to run the Etebase server:

   networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts = [ 443 ];
   services = {
     etebase-server = {
       enable = true;
       unixSocket = "/var/lib/etebase-server/etebase-server.sock";
       user = "etebase-server";
       settings = {
         global.debug = false;
         global.secret_file = "/path/to/secret";
         allowed_hosts.allowed_host1 = "etebase.your.domain";
       };
     };
     nginx = {
       enable = true;
       recommendedOptimisation = true;
       recommendedProxySettings = true;
       recommendedTlsSettings = true;
       recommendedGzipSettings = true;
       virtualHosts."etebase.your.domain" = {
         enableACME = true;
         forceSSL = true;
         locations."/".proxyPass = "http://unix:/var/lib/etebase-server/etebase-server.sock";
       };
     };
   };

  Caddy example

 services.caddy = {
   enable = true;
   virtualHosts = {
     "etebase.your.domain".extraConfig = ''
       reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8001 {
         header_up Host {upstream_hostport}
       }
     '';
   };
 };

 services.etebase-server = {
   enable = true;
   settings = {
     allowed_hosts = {
       allowed_host2 = "etebase.your.domain";
       allowed_host1 = "127.0.0.1";
     };
     global.secret_file = "/path/to/secret";
   };
 };

Admin user

   To use the Etebase server, the creation of an admin account is required.
   This requires manual intervention:

    CLI Method

   Note: This method possibly might only when using the NixOS service. If
   this command fails, use the INI Method described below

 sudo etebase-server createsuperuser

    INI Method

   First you need to find where the generated .ini configuration file is
   located:

 ls /nix/store | grep etebase-server.ini

   As a super user, run this command:
   ETEBASE_EASY_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/etebase-server.ini etebase-server
   createsuperuser and that should prompt you to create a user.

    After

   Login with these credentials to https://etebase.your.domain/admin and
   create users for your etebase clients through the GUI.
