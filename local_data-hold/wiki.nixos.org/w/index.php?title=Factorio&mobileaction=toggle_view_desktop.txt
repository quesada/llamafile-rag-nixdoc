   From NixOS Wiki

   Factorio is a video game created by Wube Software. Factorio has a
   multiplayer mode that requires a dedicated server, which is what this
   guide is about. If you have tips for installing the Factorio client,
   please feel free to expand this wiki page.

   For more specific information about Factorio multiplayer, see:
   https://wiki.factorio.com/Multiplayer

Default Server Installation

   To install the Factorio server, add "factorio-headless" to your
   "systemPackages" in your NixOS configuration:

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
   factorio-headless
 ];
 # Also enable non-free packages or else the factorio download will fail:
 nixpkgs.config.allowUnfree = true;

   It's important to only install "factorio-headless" instead of "factorio"
   because the headless version is a free download that does not require
   login credentials.

Configuration

   Here is a minimum viable configuration for the Factorio server (add this
   to your NixOS configuration):

 services.factorio = {
   enable = true;
   openFirewall = true;
 };

   This will run a non-password-protected server that binds to "0.0.0.0" and
   uses the default UDP port of 34197, with an auto-generated save file.
   Factorio servers support IPv6 by setting bind = "[::]";. All default
   settings can be seen here:

Mods

   The NixOS module for Factorio supports Factorio mods, which are just zip
   files. While technically you can create a full derivation for mods, in
   practice this can get complicated, especially since authentication is
   required to download mods from the official mod site.

   Instead, you can download the mods you need separately from
   https://mods.factorio.com/, place them in a folder such as
   /home/username/factorio-mods, and put this code in your configuration.nix
   (credit to nicball):

 services.factorio = {
   # --omitted--
   mods =
     let
       inherit (pkgs) lib;
       modDir = /home/username/factorio-mods;
       modList = lib.pipe modDir [
         builtins.readDir
         (lib.filterAttrs (k: v: v == "regular"))
         (lib.mapAttrsToList (k: v: k))
         (builtins.filter (lib.hasSuffix ".zip"))
       ];
       modToDrv = modFileName:
         pkgs.runCommand "copy-factorio-mods" {} ''
           mkdir $out
           cp ${modDir + "/${modFileName}"} $out/${modFileName}
         ''
         // { deps = []; };
     in
       builtins.map modToDrv modList;
 };

   Note that any changes to the list of mods in the "factorio-mods" folder
   require running nixos-rebuild switch.
