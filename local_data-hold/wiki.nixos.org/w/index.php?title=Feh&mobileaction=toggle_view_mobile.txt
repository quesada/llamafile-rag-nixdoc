   From NixOS Wiki

   Feh is a simple, fast and lightweight image viewer. It is controlled by
   configurable mouse and keyboard actions, as well as by command line.
   Although its interface does not include graphical elements by default, it
   is possible to add basic information.

   It is often used to control the wallpaper in window managers without this
   feature and offers multiple options for this purpose.

Installation

   It can be installed via the feh package as shown in search.nixos.org

Increase supported image types

   Since feh is able to open any file supported by the imlib2 library, it is
   possible to override the imlib2 build argument by imlib2Full to add
   support for the additional formats heif (.heic), svg, jxl, among others.
