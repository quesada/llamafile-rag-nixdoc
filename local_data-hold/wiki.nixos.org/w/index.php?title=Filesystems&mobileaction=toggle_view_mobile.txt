   From NixOS Wiki

   fileSystems is a NixOS option that allows the user to mount filesystems at
   specific mount points. The mounted filesystems may also be encrypted. Also
   see the fileSystem option documentation.

   For boot mount options, check here.

   Common example filesystem mount. You can put this in configuration.nix:

  fileSystems."/mnt/exampleDrive" = {
    device = "/dev/disk/by-uuid/4f999afe-6114-4531-ba37-4bf4a00efd9e";
    fsType = "exfat";
    options = [ # If you don't have this options attribute, it'll default to "defaults"
      # boot options for fstab. Search up fstab mount options you can use
      "users" # Allows any user to mount and unmount
      "nofail" # Prevent system from failing if this drive doesn't mount
      "exec" # Permit execution of binaries and other executable files
    ];
  };

Making disk visible in your file explorer

   You might not see the disk in your file explorer (ie GNOME Nautilus). Add
   to the options: x-gvfs-show and it'll show up.

Porting /etc/fstab

   The options specified in /etc/fstab may not be fully compatible with NixOS
   fileSystems options. For example, here are some options NixOS doesn't
   recognize that are available on some Linux distributions:

     * iocharset
     * rw (but it seems to not be needed)
     * uid with username rather than actual uid

Mount order

   Without any specification, the mount order is up to the implementation
   (probably alphabetic).

   Should the order in which filesystems are mounted is important, users
   should make use of the fileSystems.<mount>.depends option. This is useful
   for example in #Bind mounts

Bind mounts

     Bind mounting allows a filesystem hierarchy or a file to be mounted at a
     different mount point. Unlike a symbolic link, a bind mount does not
     exist on the filesystem itself. In the following example, the path
     /olddir will be mounted in /newdir ^[1]

   These are used to make files or folders available in other parts of the
   filesystem hierarchy. In order to do so both source and target filesystems
   have to be mounted first.

 fileSystems."/mnt/datastore".label = "datastore";
 fileSystems."/mnt/aggregator".label = "aggregator";

 ####################
 # Bind mounts

 # Mount /mnt/datastore/applications/app1 on /mnt/aggregator/app1
 # Accessing /mnt/aggregator/app1 will actually access /mnt/datastore/...
 fileSystems."/mnt/aggregator/app1" = {
   depends = [
       # The mounts above have to be mounted in this given order
       "/mnt/datastore"
       "/mnt/aggregator"
   ];
   device = "/mnt/datastore/applications/app1";
   fsType = "none";
   options = [
     "bind"
     "ro" # The filesystem hierarchy will be read-only when accessed from /mnt/aggregator/app1
   ];
 };
