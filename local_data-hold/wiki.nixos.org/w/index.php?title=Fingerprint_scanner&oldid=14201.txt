   Fingerprint scanners (on laptop computers) can be used to unlock devices
   instead of using passwords.

Install

 # Start the driver at boot
 systemd.services.fprintd = {
   wantedBy = [ "multi-user.target" ];
   serviceConfig.Type = "simple";
 };

 # Install the driver
 services.fprintd.enable = true;
 # If simply enabling fprintd is not enough, try enabling fprintd.tod...
 services.fprintd.tod.enable = true;
 # ...and use one of the next four drivers
 services.fprintd.tod.driver = pkgs.libfprint-2-tod1-goodix; # Goodix driver module
 # services.fprintd.tod.driver = pkgs.libfprint-2-tod1-elan # Elan(04f3:0c4b) driver
 # services.fprintd.tod.driver = pkgs.libfprint-2-tod1-vfs0090; # driver for 2016 ThinkPads
 # services.fprintd.tod.driver = pkgs.libfprint-2-tod1-goodix-550a # Goodix 550a driver (from Lenovo)

Enroll fingerprint

   Just run

 sudo fprintd-enroll

   or use the UI in the Desktop Environment if available.
