   NixOS provides an interface to configure the firewall through the option
   networking.firewall.

   The default firewall uses iptables. To use the newer nftables instead,
   additionally set networking.nftables.enable = true;

Enable

   The firewall is enabled when not set. To explicitly enable it add the
   following into your system configuration:

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 networking.firewall.enable = true;

   This will make all local ports and services unreachable from external
   connections.

Configuration

   To allow specific TCP/UDP ports or port ranges on all interfaces, use
   following syntax:

 networking.firewall = {
   enable = true;
   allowedTCPPorts = [ 80 443 ];
   allowedUDPPortRanges = [
     { from = 4000; to = 4007; }
     { from = 8000; to = 8010; }
   ];
 };

   Note: Many services also provide an option to open the required firewall
   ports automatically. For example, the media server Jellyfin offers the
   option services.jellyfin.openFirewall = true; which will open the required
   TCP ports.

   Interface-specific firewall rules can be applied like this:

 networking.firewall.interfaces."eth0".allowedTCPPorts = [ 80 443 ];

   In this case, ports 80 and 443 will be allowed for the interface eth0.

Warning

   Firewall rules may be overwritten by Docker, as per
   https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/111852
