   fwupd is a simple daemon allowing you to update some devices' firmware,
   including UEFI for several machines.

   Supported devices are listed here and more are to come.

Installation

   To use and install fwup daemon and user space client, add following part
   to your config:

 services.fwupd.enable = true;

Usage

   To display all devices detected by fwupd:

 $ fwupdmgr get-devices

   Note: Listed devices may not be updatable through fwupd (e.g. Intel
   integrated graphics). Alternative vendor solutions may be provided
   instead.

   To download the latest metadata from the Linux Vendor Firmware Service
   (LVFS):

 $ fwupdmgr refresh

   To list updates available for any devices on the system:

 $ fwupdmgr get-updates

   To install updates:

 $ fwupdmgr update

   Note:
     * Updates that can be applied live will be done immediately.
     * Updates that run at bootup will be staged for the next reboot.
     * The root user may be required to perform certain device updates.
