   Some Logitech keyboards have LEDs. G810-led is a LED controller for
   Logitech G213, G410, G413, G512, G513, G610, G810, g815, G910 and GPRO
   keyboards.

Installation

   The program MatMoul/g810-led is provided by the package pkgs.g810-led.

   To be able to run it, you should add the following udev config :

 services.udev = {
   packages = [
     pkgs.g810-led
   ];
 };

   After a nixos-rebuild switch you should be able to run g810-led -a ff0000.

Add colors at keyboard plug

   Currently, you need to run this command after you plug your keyboard in,
   with the following udev rule, you are able to run the command
   automatically after any USB device is plugged in :

 services.udev = {
   packages = [
     pkgs.g810-led
   ];
   extraRules = ''
     ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", RUN+="${pkgs.g810-led}/bin/g810-led -a 0000ff"
   '';
 };
