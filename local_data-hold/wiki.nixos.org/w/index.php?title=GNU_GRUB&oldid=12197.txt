FAQ

   → See Bootloader#FAQ as those questions also applies to GRUB.

  this GPT partition label contains no BIOS Boot Partition

   This error is caused by using grub for legacy boot with a disk formatted
   as GPT^[1].

   This can be fixed either by:

     * Using a MBR partition scheme
     * Adding a BIOS boot partition among your GPT partitions.

     Reason: Add the steps required here. Explain as if inside the nixos      
     installer environment. (Discuss in Talk:GNU GRUB#)

  How do I use GRUB in text mode?

   Sometimes you need to access GRUB in text mode (e.g. when using out of
   band management systems like HP ILO in "textcons" mode).

   To use GRUB in text mode there are two settings that need to be configured
   depending on whether you use EFI or BIOS boot:

 boot.loader.grub.gfxmodeEfi= "text";
 boot.loader.grub.gfxmodeBios= "text";

   Only disabling the GRUB splash screen via boot.loader.grub.splashImage =
   null; results in a similar output but that is not the real text only mode.
