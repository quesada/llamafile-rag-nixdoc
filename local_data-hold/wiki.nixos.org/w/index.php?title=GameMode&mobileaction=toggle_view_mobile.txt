   GameMode is a daemon/lib combo for Linux that allows games to request a
   set of optimisations be temporarily applied to the host OS and/or a game
   process.

Installation

   GameMode depends on root-level capabilities that aren't available in a
   user-level Nix package installation. The easiest way to set this up is to
   use the NixOS module:

 programs.gamemode.enable = true;

Running

   To run games with GameMode start it like this:

 $ gamemoderun ./game

   When you have started your game you can verify that GameMode is running
   with the command:

 $ gamemoded -s

  Steam

   To make sure Steam starts a game with GameMode, right click the game,
   select Properties..., then Launch Options and enter:

 gamemoderun %command%

Verifying Optimisations

   gamemoded -t can be used to verify that the optimisations for your
   configuration get applied:

 $ gamemoded -t
 : Loading config
 Loading config file [/nix/store/p8dbmpdak57psrb5c0mz7crsc95nfzs6-gamemode-1.6.1/share/gamemode/gamemode.ini]
 Loading config file [/etc/gamemode.ini]

Known Errors

     Tip                                                                      
     The logs of the daemon service can be accessed with journalctl --user -u 
     gamemoded.service.                                                       

   Renice & ioprio optimisations sometimes fail. This is caused by GameMode
   trying to apply optimisations on processes that exit before the
   optimisations can be applied. See FeralInteractive/gamemode#167 (comment).

 ERROR: Could not inspect tasks for client [329118]! Skipping ioprio optimisation.
 ERROR: Refused to renice client [31477,31477]: prio was (-10) but we expected (0)

   If you don't have an Intel CPU, you will get errors about failing to read
   the energy levels. This isn't a real problem. It just means that
   optimizations for integrated graphics cards won't be enabled:

 ERROR: Failed to open file for read /sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl/intel-rapl:0/intel-rapl:0:0/energy_uj

   If you don't have a screensaver installed, you will get the following
   error:

 ERROR: Could not call Inhibit on org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver: No route to host
         org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown
         The name org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver was not provided by any .service files

   You can disable the screensaver inhibiter to get rid of those errors:

 programs.gamemode.settings.general.inhibit_screensaver = 0;

   Setting the power scheme might result in the following error:

 ::: Verifying CPU governor setting
 ERROR: Governor was not set to performance (was actually schedutil)!
 ::: Failed!

   Adding the the user to the gamemode group resolves this error.
