   Gammastep is a program that adjusts the color temperature of your screen
   according to your surroundings. By reducing the amount of blue light
   emitted it may help to reduce strain on the eyes if working in front of
   the screen at night.

Installation

   Using Home Manager Gammastep can be enabled for a specific user with the
   following syntax

 home-manager.users.myUser = {
   services.gammastep = {
     enable = true;
     provider = "manual";
     latitude = 49.0;
     longitude = 8.4;
   };
 };

   To properly work, Gammastep needs your location to know when the sun will
   be setting and it gets dark outside, so that it can automatically adjust
   your screen temperature accordingly. Replace myUser with your user name
   running the graphical session and latitude and longitude with your
   geographical position.
