Example Configuration

 { config, pkgs, ... }: {
     # We will be using nginx as web server. As nginx doesnt support cgi scrips
     # but fastcgi. We need fcgiwrap to forward requests
     # -(https)-> nginx -(fastcgi)-> fcgiwrap -(cgi)-> git-http-backend
     services.fcgiwrap.enable = true;
     services.fcgiwrap.user = "nginx";
     services.nginx.enable = true;

     services.nginx.virtualHosts."git.example.com" = {
         # use ssl for all requests; dissallow unencrypted requests
         enableACME = true; # If you want to use Let's Encrypt for SSL certificates
         forceSSL = true;
         # this regex is needed to catch the path the git client is requesting
         locations."~ (/.*)" = {

           # This is where the repositories live on the server
           root = "/folder/to/public/repos";

           # Setup FastCGI for Git HTTP Backend
           extraConfig = ''
             fastcgi_pass        unix:/run/fcgiwrap.sock;
             include             ${pkgs.nginx}/conf/fastcgi_params;
             # All parameters below will be forwarded to fcgiwrap which then starts
             # the git http proces with the the params as environment variables except
             # for SCRIPT_FILENAME. See "man git-http-server" for more information on them.
             fastcgi_param       SCRIPT_FILENAME     ${pkgs.git}/bin/git-http-backend;
             fastcgi_param       GIT_PROJECT_ROOT /hdd/gitolite/www-public;
             # CAREFULL! only include this option if you want all the repos in $root to
             # to be read.
             fastcgi_param       GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL "";
             # use the path from the regex in the location
             fastcgi_param       PATH_INFO           $1;
             '';
         };
     };
 }
