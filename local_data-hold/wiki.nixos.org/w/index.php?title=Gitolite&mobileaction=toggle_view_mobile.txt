   Gitolite allows you to host git repositories with fine-grained access
   control.

Installation

   Obtain the SSH public key of the user you will use to configure gitolite,
   then add the following to your NixOS config:

   services.gitolite = {
     enable = true;
     adminPubkey = "<ssh public key>";
   };

   When you rebuild, a new unit should start:

 the following new units were started: gitolite-init.service

   You can now check out the gitolite-admin repo using the gitolite user.
   Gitolite's configuration is located in conf/gitolite.conf and you can give
   users access by adding their public keys to keydir.
