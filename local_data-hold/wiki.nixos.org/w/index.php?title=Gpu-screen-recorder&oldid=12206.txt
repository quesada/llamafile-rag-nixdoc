   gpu-screen-recorder is a screen recorder that has minimal impact on system
   performance by recording your monitor using the GPU only, similar to
   ShadowPlay on Windows.

    Supported codecs

      Video

     * H264 (default on Intel)
     * HEVC (default on AMD and NVIDIA)
     * AV1

      Audio

     * Opus (default)
     * AAC
     * FLAC

Installation

   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     gpu-screen-recorder # CLI
     gpu-screen-recorder-gtk # GUI
   ];

Troubleshooting

    libnvidia-fbc.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or
    directory

   The possibility of this error arising exists if you possess an NVIDIA
   graphics card, as the package does not include the NVIDIA X11 libraries in
   its wrapper by default.

    1. Make sure your drivers are installed.
    2. Install the missing the NVENC patch for your card. nvidia-patch is a
       great overlay which you can use
    3. Override the package build inputs and add the library to the wrapper.

 {
   environment.systemPackages = [
     (pkgs.runCommand "gpu-screen-recorder" {
       nativeBuildInputs = [ pkgs.makeWrapper ];
     } ''
       mkdir -p $out/bin
       makeWrapper ${pkgs.gpu-screen-recorder}/bin/gpu-screen-recorder $out/bin/gpu-screen-recorder \
         --prefix LD_LIBRARY_PATH : ${pkgs.libglvnd}/lib \
         --prefix LD_LIBRARY_PATH : ${config.boot.kernelPackages.nvidia_x11}/lib
     '')
   ];
 }
