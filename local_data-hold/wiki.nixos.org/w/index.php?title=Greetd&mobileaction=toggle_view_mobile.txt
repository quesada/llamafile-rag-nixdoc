   greetd is a minimal login manager.

Usage

   Using this configuration, greetd will use the greeter gtkgreet, asking for
   user, password and which session to start as defined in the
   /etc/greetd/environments file:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 { config, lib, pkgs, ... }:
 let
   swayConfig = pkgs.writeText "greetd-sway-config" ''
     # `-l` activates layer-shell mode. Notice that `swaymsg exit` will run after gtkgreet.
     exec "${pkgs.greetd.gtkgreet}/bin/gtkgreet -l; swaymsg exit"
     bindsym Mod4+shift+e exec swaynag \
       -t warning \
       -m 'What do you want to do?' \
       -b 'Poweroff' 'systemctl poweroff' \
       -b 'Reboot' 'systemctl reboot'
   '';
 in
 {
   services.greetd = {
     enable = true;
     settings = {
       default_session = {
         command = "${pkgs.sway}/bin/sway --config ${swayConfig}";
       };
     };
   };

   environment.etc."greetd/environments".text = ''
     sway
     fish
     bash
     startxfce4
   '';
 }

   In this minimal example, the Wayland compositor Sway automatically gets
   executed by the user myuser after successfull boot, no password required:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.greetd = {
   enable = true;
   settings = rec {
     initial_session = {
       command = "${pkgs.sway}/bin/sway";
       user = "myuser";
     };
     default_session = initial_session;
   };
 };

   initial_session is executed automatically. If you just define
   default_session, greetd will ask for a password and execute command with
   user myuser.

   Note:

   If you're hosting gtkgreet in a Wayland compositor, there is a known
   issue, between GTK portals and dbus, of a delay before the greeter
   appears,. There are a couple known workarounds depending on the compositor
   you're using:
