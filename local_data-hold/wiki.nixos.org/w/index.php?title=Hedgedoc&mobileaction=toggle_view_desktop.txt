   From NixOS Wiki

   Hedgedoc is a is an open-source, web-based, self-hosted, collaborative
   markdown editor.

   You can use it to easily collaborate on notes, graphs and even
   presentations in real-time. For this you can use a just the same link to
   the pad.

Install and run hedgedoc

   You can just enable it. There are 15 options in Nixpkgs to configure it.

   services.hedgedoc = {
     enable = true;
   }

Usage with nginx reverse proxy

   Hedgedoc itself provides a web server. In most cases you will use a web
   server like nginx to provide SSL and access to static hedgedoc files as
   well as the hedgedoc websocket. In a setup with a VM/internal machine on
   192.168.1.100 and a public accessible reverse proxy/VM host running the
   „hedgedoc.example.com“ domain you will probably use a setup like this:

  Hedgedoc server (virtual machine/internal server)

   Hedgedoc does not need more than a handful options for configuration.

   networking.firewall = {
     allowedTCPPorts = [ 8001 ];
   };
   services.hedgedoc = {
     enable = true;
     settings.domain = "hedgedoc.example.com";
     settings.port = 8001;
     settings.host = "192.168.1.100"; # IP of the VM (or public IP of webserver)
     settings.protocolUseSSL = true;
     settings.allowOrigin = [
         "localhost"
         "hedgedoc.example.com"
     ];
   };

   Notice: With this configuration hedgedoc is freely usable without
   authentification. In the current version of hedgedoc there is no admin
   backend. To have control about the users you can restrict usage by
   disabling self registration (allowEmailRegister) and guest access
   (allowAnonymous): Set both to false in services.hedgedoc.settings.

  Nginx reverse proxy (virtualization host/server with public IPv4)

   The reverse proxy for https://hedgedoc.example.com with an internal
   hedgedoc server running on 192.168.1.100 will work with this:

 services.nginx = {
     enable = true;

     # Use recommended settings
     recommendedGzipSettings = true;
     recommendedOptimisation = true;
     recommendedProxySettings = true;
     recommendedTlsSettings = true;

     # Only allow PFS-enabled ciphers with AES256
     sslCiphers = "AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:!aNULL";

     virtualHosts."hedgedoc.example.com" = {
         forceSSL = true;
         enableACME = true;
         root = "/var/www/hedgedoc";
         locations."/".proxyPass = "http://192.168.1.100:8001";
         locations."/socket.io/" = {
           proxyPass = "http://192.168.1.100:8001";
           proxyWebsockets = true;
           extraConfig =
             "proxy_ssl_server_name on;"
             ;
         };
     };
   };
