   From NixOS Wiki

   Helix is a modal text-editor inspired by Neovim and Kakoune, written in
   Rust. Compared to neovim, it is preconfigured with the functions that most
   people need (for example tree-sitter for syntax highlighting). It has no
   plugin system. It uses (neo-)vim motions keybindings, but it uses the
   object-verb approach (visually highlighting text and then executing a
   function on it). It is intended for people who like to use a modal text
   editor but don't want to spend a lot of time configuring it.

Installation

   Helix can be installed system-wide on NixOS with the helix package:

 environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.helix ];

   Depending on the programming languages it is helpful to install additional
   packages from nixpgks. To show what packages are needed, it is helpful to
   check hx --health.

  With Home Manager

   Home Manager provides a module for configuring helix.

 programs.helix = {
   enable = true;
   settings = {
     theme = "autumn_night_transparent";
     editor.cursor-shape = {
       normal = "block";
       insert = "bar";
       select = "underline";
     };
   };
   languages.language = [{
     name = "nix";
     auto-format = true;
     formatter.command = lib.getExe pkgs.nixfmt-rfc-style;
   }];
   themes = {
     autumn_night_transparent = {
       "inherits" = "autumn_night";
       "ui.background" = { };
     };
   };
 };

Configuration

   The configuration is stored in two files: ~/.config/helix/config.toml and
   ~/.config/helix/language.toml.

     * The full configuration options are described on the Helix
       documentation.
     * For programming languages (LSP, formatter, ..) see the Helix wiki.
