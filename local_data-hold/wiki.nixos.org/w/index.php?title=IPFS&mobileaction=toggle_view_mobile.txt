   From NixOS Wiki

   IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a protocol, hypermedia and file
   sharing peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed
   file system. IPFS aims to make the web more efficient, resilient, and open
   by using content-addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global
   namespace. IPFS also enables persistent availability of data with or
   without internet backbone connectivity, and complements HTTP.

Installation

   Install and enable kubo (which is the recommended IPFS implementation) and
   add your user to the correct group

 services.kubo = {
   enable = true;
 };
 users.users.alice.extraGroups = [ config.services.kubo.group ];

   Note that after enabling this option and rebuilding your system, you need
   to log out and back in for the "IPFS_PATH" environment variable to be
   present in your shell and for your user to become part of the ipfs group.
   Until you do that, the CLI tools won't be able to talk to the daemon by
   default.

Usage

   Publish a file and read it afterwards

 # echo "hello world" > hello
 # ipfs add hello
 This should output a hash string that looks something like:
 QmT78zSuBmuS4z925WZfrqQ1qHaJ56DQaTfyMUF7F8ff5o
 # ipfs cat <that hash>

   Download a file given a hash

 # ipfs get <hash>

   Publish and print directory content. For the ls command, use the hash of
   the root directory.

 # ipfs add -r folder
 # ipfs ls <hash>
 # ipfs ls <hash>/subdirectory
