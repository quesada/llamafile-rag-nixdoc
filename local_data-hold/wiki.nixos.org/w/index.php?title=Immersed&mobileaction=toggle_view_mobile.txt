   From NixOS Wiki

   Immersed is a virtual and augmented reality application for work and
   productivity.

   It is packaged as 'immersed-vr' in Nixpkgs, but in order to work on NixOS,
   you will need additional OpenGL libraries.

 hardware.graphics = { # hardware.opengl in 24.05
         enable = true;
         enable32Bit = true; # driSupport32Bit in 24.05
         extraPackages = with pkgs; [ libva vaapiVdpau ];
 };

   As of April 2024, the support for Wayland is experimental. The first
   version to support it is in this pull request. On Gnome, you might also
   have to turn on accessibility zoom (if you set it to 100% it does not
   change the appearance) to see your mouse cursor.
