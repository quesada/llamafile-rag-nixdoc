   From NixOS Wiki

   Amazon EC2 is a widely used cloud deployment platform that is part of
   Amazon Web Services (AWS). NixOS largely supports the platform through
   AMIs and the nixos-generators project.

Public NixOS AMIs

   A list of NixOS AMI's available on AWS is located here and for a more up
   to date list: here (cf. this discourse thread).

   The default user for these AMI's is root. There isn't a default password,
   instead authentication is done by using the SSH key selected during the
   EC2 creation process.

Creating a NixOS AMI

   The nixos-generators project is currently the best method to create your
   own NixOS AMI. Follow the directions provided by nixos-generators & then
   follow the instructions provided by AWS.

Troubleshooting

SSH Asks For Password

   When connecting to a newly launched EC2 instance via SSH, it may ask for a
   password. This seems to be because the amazon-init systemd service is
   still reading user data. Back out of the current SSH attempt and try again
   in a few minutes.
