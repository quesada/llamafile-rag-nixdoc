   I've tested this with the Dedibox SC2 and the Dedibox XC, but see no
   reason for it not to work with all of their configurations.

   Start by installing a flavor of Linux (don't care which, since we'll be
   blowing it away) using the standard Online.net control panel. Make sure
   the partition layout is as you'd like it, because I'm not including
   instructions below for changing that.

   You don't even need to wait for it to finish booting; click the rescue
   button on the right and tell it to boot into the ubuntu rescue console.
   It'll give you a temporary password for the rescue ssh session. Ssh into
   the rescue image and let's get started!

Preparation

  Be root

   No reason not to be:

 sudo su
 cd

  Create builders

 groupadd nixbld
 useradd nixbld1
 useradd nixbld2
 useradd nixbld3
 useradd nixbld4
 gpasswd -a nixbld1 nixbld
 gpasswd -a nixbld2 nixbld
 gpasswd -a nixbld3 nixbld
 gpasswd -a nixbld4 nixbld

  Add missing packages

 apt install bzip2 btrfs-tools

  Change the UI language

   All the Online.net images are set to French by default, which I don't
   want:

 export LANG=POSIX
 export LC_ALL=POSIX

  Check your partitions

   Now, make sure your partitions are where you expect them, on /dev/sda.

 fdisk -l /dev/sda

   Here's what mine look like on a Dedibox XC:

 /dev/sda1 *          2048     391167    194560  83 Linux
 /dev/sda2          391168 1949523967 974566400  83 Linux
 /dev/sda3      1949523968 1953523711   1999872  82 Linux swap / Solaris

  Format your partitions

   This will blast away any existing data on your main disk, so make sure
   you're okay with that.

 mkfs.ext2 /dev/sda1
 mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2 -L nixos

 swapoff -a
 mkswap /dev/sda3

  Mount your freshly minted filesystems

   and mount the new ones we made:

 mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
 mkdir /mnt/boot
 mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
 swapon /dev/sda3

Nix-flavored stuff

  Get nix onto the rescue system

   We'll need some nix packages to install nix on the target:

 bash <(curl https://nixos.org/nix/install)
 . /root/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh
 nix-channel --remove nixpkgs
 nix-channel --add http://nixos.org/channels/nixos-17.09 nixos
 nix-channel --update

 cat <<EOF > configuration.nix
 { fileSystems."/" = {};
   boot.loader.grub.enable = false;
 }
 EOF

 export NIX_PATH=nixpkgs=/root/.nix-defexpr/channels/nixos:nixos=/root/.nix-defexpr/channels/nixos/nixos
 export NIXOS_CONFIG=/root/configuration.nix
 nix-env -i -A config.system.build.nixos-install -A config.system.build.nixos-option -A config.system.build.nixos-generate-config -f "<nixos>"

  Make configuration for your target system

   Generate a default configuration:

 nixos-generate-config --root /mnt

   This will generate /mnt/etc/nixos/configuration.nix and
   /mnt/etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix. Eyeball the latter (nano is
   preinstalled) to make sure the filesystem config looks reasonable and that
   it's detected your cores correctly. Then customize the former to your
   liking. By default it'll use DHCP, which didn't seem to work for me on
   online.net (please tinker and tell me if you got it working with DHCP
   though), so make sure to customize the network settings if you don't
   change anything else.

   If you need to figure out your current network settings to fill in the
   gaps in my settings file, try cat /etc/resolv.conf and cat
   /etc/network/interfaces.

   Here's a sample config from my box:

 { config, pkgs, ... }:

 {
   imports =
     [ # Include the results of the hardware scan.
       ./hardware-configuration.nix
     ];
  
   boot.loader.grub = {
     enable  = true;
     version = 2;
     device  = "/dev/sda";
   };
  
   # Not strictly required, but useful to be able to use the serial console
   boot.kernelParams = [ "console=ttyS1" ];

   networking.hostName        = "yourhostname";
   networking.interfaces.eth0 = { ipAddress = "your ip address"; prefixLength = 24; };
   networking.defaultGateway  = "your gateway";
   networking.nameservers     = [ "62.210.16.6" "62.210.16.7" ];
 
   # By default, systemd "predictable interface names" are used for network interfaces.
   # Since the Dedibox SC only has one network interface, it is safe to disable this,
   # and simply use eth0 as above.
   # If you remove this line, you need to replace "eth0" above by the correct interface name.
   networking.usePredictableInterfaceNames = false;

   i18n.defaultLocale = "en_US.UTF-8";

   # environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
   #   wget
   # ];

   time.timeZone = "America/New_York";

   services.openssh.enable = true;

   security.sudo.wheelNeedsPassword = false;

   users.extraUsers.youruser =
     { createHome      = true;
       home            = "/home/youruser";
       description     = "your name";
       extraGroups     = [ "wheel" ];
       useDefaultShell = true;
       openssh.authorizedKeys.keys = [
         "<your pubkey here>"
       ];
     };
 }

  Actually install the system

 unset NIXOS_CONFIG
 nixos-install

   That should spend some time downloading and copying stuff around, and then
   should fail without error. After that, tell the web console to reboot back
   into normal mode and your machine will be beautifully nixified. Except for
   the logo stuck on the Online.net console page. Let me know if you figure
   out how to get rid of that!

Troubleshooting

   If nixos-install fails to download files from the internet, check that
   your rescue image's /etc/resolv.confis not a symlink. The issue should be
   fixed now, but at some point the nixos-install chroot process would not
   copy symlinks appropriately, so things would not resolve in the jail.

   See this commit for the fix.
