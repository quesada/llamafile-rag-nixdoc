Driver

   Refer to the Intel Graphics drivers section of the NixOS manual.

Video acceleration

   To enable hardware (GPU) accelerated video decoding and encoding you need
   to add additional entries in hardware.graphics.extraPackages (see
   accelerated video playback).

Quick Sync Video

   Intel Quick Sync Video (QSV) is a hardware accelerated media conversion
   framework for Intel GPUs. Applications that can be accelerated using QSV
   include OBS Studio and ffmpeg.

   QSV support can be used through either Intel Media SDK or Intel VPL. Intel
   VPL supersedes the now deprecated Media SDK.

   Both libraries dispatch to a backing implementation that is different
   depending on the GPU generation at runtime. You need to add either
   intel-media-sdk or vpl-gpu-rt (previously onevpl-intel-gpu) to
   hardware.graphics.extraPackages. You can check the this table to decide
   whether you need the Media SDK or VPL GPU runtime.

   Sample configuration:

   hardware.graphics = { # hardware.opengl in 24.05
     enable = true;
     extraPackages = with pkgs; [
       ... # your Open GL, Vulkan and VAAPI drivers
       vpl-gpu-rt # or intel-media-sdk for QSV
     ];
   };

12th Gen (Alder Lake)

   The X Server may fail to start with the newer 12th generation, Alder Lake,
   iRISxe integrated graphics chips. If this is the case, you can give the
   kernel a hint as to what driver to use. First confirm the graphic chip's
   device ID by running in a terminal:

 $ nix-shell -p pciutils --run "lspci -nn | grep VGA"
 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation Alder Lake-UP3 GT2 [Iris Xe Graphics] [8086:46a8] (rev 0c)

   In this example, "46a8" is the device ID. You can then add this to your
   configuration and reboot:

 boot.kernelParams = [ "i915.force_probe=<device ID>" ];
