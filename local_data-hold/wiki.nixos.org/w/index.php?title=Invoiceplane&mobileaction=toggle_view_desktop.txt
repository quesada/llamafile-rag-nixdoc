   From NixOS Wiki

   Invoiceplane is a web application for managing invoices, clients and
   payments.

Installation

   To setup Invoiceplane locally, this is the most minimal configuration to
   get started

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.invoiceplane.sites."localhost".enable = true;

   After that Invoiceplane will be available at http://localhost . Complete
   the setup by choosing your default language and setting up your user
   profile.

   It is recommended to disable the setup wizard after installation is
   complete. Add following arguments to the settings option:

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.invoiceplane.sites."localhost".settings = {
   DISABLE_SETUP=true;
   SETUP_COMPLETED=true;
 };

Configuration

  Invoice templates

   Invoiceplane will render and export invoices as PDF. You can create your
   own invoice templates or reuse existing ones. The following example
   fetches an invoice template and makes it available to your running
   Invoiceplane instance

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 { config, pkgs, lib, ... }:
 let

   template-vtdirektmarketing = pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
     name = "vtdirektmarketing";
     src = pkgs.fetchgit {
       url = "https://git.project-insanity.org/onny/invoiceplane-vtdirektmarketing.git";
       rev = "0c5807132ea6cecdb9d031d9b61e478d371f7607";
       hash = "sha256-sVunmCWRYcZwADQLhQHiuU4faMB05hEqwH1/os1Rxqo=";
     };
     makeFlags = [ "DESTDIR=$(out)" ];
   };

 in {

   services.invoiceplane.sites."localhost" = {
     enable = true;
     invoiceTemplates = [ template-vtdirektmarketing ];
   };

 }

  Invoice mail delivery

   There are several methods to automatically deliver invoices via mail.
   First we have to configure which mail backend to use. One method which is
   confirmed to work on NixOS is to use sendmail. Using a configured program
   like Msmtp to relay mails from your server using your existing mail
   provider. Unfortunately it is not yet possible to configure the mail
   backend with extraSettings. In this case navigate in the web interface to:
   Settings → System settings → E-Mail and set mail delivery method to
   Sendmail.

   Invoices can be send directly while editing them. It is also possible to
   create a common mail template which can be reused. Go to Settings → Mail
   templates. To configure a default mail template, go to Settings → System
   settings → Invoices.

  Recurring invoices

   See upstream documentation on how to configure recurring. invoices. This
   feature requires a cron task setup which queries the Invoiceplane backend
   every few minutes. This can be configured with the Invoiceplane module as
   follows

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.invoiceplane.sites."localhost" = {
   cron.enable = true;
   cron.key = "1234";
 };

   Replace the cron key value with the one given in the Invoiceplane
   administration web interface.

  Electronic invoice

   To enable electronic invoicing using the standard ZUGFeRD, we can hardcode
   the activation into the InvoicePlane source code. Otherwise it has to be
   manually enabled in the settings menu of the web app.

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 nixpkgs = {
   overlays = [
     (self: super: {
       invoiceplane = super.invoiceplane.overrideAttrs (oldAttrs: rec {
         postFixup = ''
           sed -i 's/\$include_zugferd = .*/$include_zugferd = true;/g' $out/application/helpers/pdf_helper.php
         '';
       });
     })
   ];
 };

   Enabling this via settings option is not yet possible.

Maintenance

  Upgrading to new versions

   After upgrading to a new version of Invoiceplane, change following two
   lines of your Invoiceplane config to re-enable the setup wizard, required
   for database upgrades.

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.invoiceplane.sites."localhost".settings = {
   DISABLE_SETUP=false;
   SETUP_COMPLETED=false;
 };

   Access your Invoiceplane instance again in your browser and rerun the
   setup. After upgrading the tables you can login as usual. It is now
   recommended to change both variables in the config file above back to
   true.
