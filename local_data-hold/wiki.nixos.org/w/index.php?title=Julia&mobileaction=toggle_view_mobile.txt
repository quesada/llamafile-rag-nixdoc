   From NixOS Wiki

   Julia is a programming language, that aims to create an unprecedented
   combination of ease-of-use, power, and efficiency in a single language.

Installation And Versions

   You can install the newest version of Julia either with julia-bin (the
   derivation which downloads the binary) or julia (the derivation which
   builds Julia from the source). From the end-user perspective, -bin
   packages should be indistinguishable from source-built ones.

Packages

   Some Julia packages expect binaries to be installed on your system. Until
   a better solution is found, you can run Julia inside Distrobox.

   Most notably, Julia Plots does not work. You can use Gadfly instead.

   Another solution is to enable nix-ld, see also here.
