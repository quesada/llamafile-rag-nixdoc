   KDE Connect is an application with various functions for integrating a
   phone and the Linux computer. It allows you to send files to the other
   device, control its media playback, send remote control inputs, display
   its notifications and much more. KDE Connect is also available for the
   GNOME desktop environment as GSConnect extension.

  Installation

    KDE

 programs.kdeconnect.enable = true;

    KDE via Home Manager

 home-manager.users.username.services.kdeconnect.enable = true;

 networking.firewall = rec {
   allowedTCPPortRanges = [ { from = 1714; to = 1764; } ];
   allowedUDPPortRanges = allowedTCPPortRanges;
 };

    GSConnect (for GNOME)

 programs.kdeconnect = {
   enable = true;
   package = pkgs.gnomeExtensions.gsconnect;
 };

   Then it is necessary to enable "GSConnect" extension in the Gnome
   "Extensions" application (or via dconf).

    GSConnect (for GNOME) via Home Manager

 home-manager.users.username.programs.gnome-shell = {
   enable = true;
   extensions = [{ package = pkgs.gnomeExtensions.gsconnect; }];
 };

 networking.firewall = rec {
   allowedTCPPortRanges = [ { from = 1714; to = 1764; } ];
   allowedUDPPortRanges = allowedTCPPortRanges;
 };

   This will auto-enable the extension via dconf.
