20.09 and later

   In 20.09 there's services.xserver.extraLayouts for this.

Using xkbcomp

  Simple

   The easiest way to customize your keyboard layout on NixOS is with these
   options:

     * services.xserver.xkb.layout: Keyboard layout, or multiple keyboard
       layouts separated by commas.
     * services.xserver.xkb.variant: X keyboard variant or multiple variants
       separated by commas (a variant can be empty).
     * services.xserver.xkb.model: Keyboard model.
     * services.xserver.xkb.options: X keyboard options; layout switching
       goes here.

      Example:

   For desktop:

 services.xserver.xkb = {
   layout = "us,ru";
   variant = "workman,";
   options = "grp:win_space_toggle";
 };

   For console:

 console.keyMap = "us";

   You can find valid values for these options in $(nix-build --no-out-link
   '<nixpkgs>' -A xkeyboard_config)/etc/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst

  Advanced

   If the above options aren't enough, you can instead create your own
   keyboard layout by going through xkb. To get started, install xorg.xkbcomp
   and run setxkbmap -print > layout.xkb to get an initial file. This
   corresponds to your current layout. Use xkbcomp layout.xkb $DISPLAY to
   load the file as your new layout. Refer to
   https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/X_KeyBoard_extension on how to edit
   this file.

   Lots of examples can be found in $(nix-build --no-out-link '<nixpkgs>' -A
   xorg.xkeyboardconfig)/etc/X11/xkb/. For available key symbols, see
   $(nix-build --no-out-link '<nixpkgs>' -A
   xorg.xproto)/include/X11/keysymdef.h.

   To load this file at the start of the X session, add the following to your
   configuration.nix. The extra compilation step (xkbcomp) helps catching
   layout errors at build time.

 let
   compiledLayout = pkgs.runCommand "keyboard-layout" {} ''
     ${pkgs.xorg.xkbcomp}/bin/xkbcomp ${./path/to/layout.xkb} $out
   '';
 in
   services.xserver.displayManager.sessionCommands = "${pkgs.xorg.xkbcomp}/bin/xkbcomp ${compiledLayout} $DISPLAY";

   If you are using home-manager, you also need to prevent home-manager from
   managing the keyboard by having home.keyboard = null; in your home-manager
   configuration.

  Relevant other options

     * services.xserver.exportConfiguration: Makes it so the above mentioned
       xkb directory (and the xorg.conf file) gets exported to /etc/X11/xkb,
       which is useful if you have to often look stuff up in it.
     * services.xserver.xkb.dir: Allows you to set a different xkb directory
       altogether. All the above mentioned things will use this instead of
       the default one in regards to xkb stuff.
     * console.useXkbConfig: Makes it so the tty console has about the same
       layout as the one configured in the services.xserver options.

  Configs

  Advanced configuration with xmodmap

   Some users have found xmodmap to be a helpful tool although reports of
   successful implementation are varied.

 cat /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.xserver.displayManager.sessionCommands =
   ${pkgs.xorg.xmodmap}/bin/xmodmap "${pkgs.writeText  "xkb-layout" ''
     ! Map umlauts to RIGHT ALT + <key>
       keycode 108 = Mode_switch
       keysym e = e E EuroSign
       keysym c = c C cent
       keysym a = a A adiaeresis Adiaeresis
       keysym o = o O odiaeresis Odiaeresis
       keysym u = u U udiaeresis Udiaeresis
       keysym s = s S ssharp
    
       ! disable capslock
       ! remove Lock = Caps_Lock
   ''}"

   Works after boot and after suspend/resume.

   You may need to add some delay to make xmodmap command work.

   services.xserver.displayManager.sessionCommands = "sleep 5 && ${pkgs.xorg.xmodmap}/bin/xmodmap -e 'keycode 43 = h H Left H' &";
