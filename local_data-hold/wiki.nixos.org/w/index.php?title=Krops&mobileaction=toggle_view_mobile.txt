   krops is a lightweight toolkit to deploy NixOS systems, remotely or
   locally.

  How it works

   krops does not deploy systems by itself, it is not a conventional
   deployment tool. It is a tool to generate scripts which then are able to
   deploy a system, so it can be thought of as a framework for deploying
   systems.

   A declarative configuration can be deployed via krops without
   modification, only requirement is that the system that is deployed is
   accessible via a ssh root login.

   The in-depth example by Ingolf Wagner shows how to configure krops for
   deploying one or multiple remote systems.
