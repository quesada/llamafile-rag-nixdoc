   From NixOS Wiki

   LibreOffice is a multi-platform office suite. It consists of programs for
   word processing (Writer); creating and editing spreadsheets (Calc),
   slideshows (Impress), diagrams and drawings (Draw); working with databases
   (Base); and composing mathematical formulae (Math).

Spellcheck

   In order for spellcheck to work, you will need to install the hunspell
   package as well as the hunspellDicts. packages for the languages that you
   would like. For example this installs libreoffice with dictionaries for
   Ukrainian and Central Thai.

   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     libreoffice-qt
     hunspell
     hunspellDicts.uk_UA
     hunspellDicts.th_TH
   ];

uno Python Library for API access

   With uno.py it is possible to access the LibreOffice API with Python. For
   getting uno.py python library to work the special path
   /lib/libreoffice/program needs to be included into the python path as well
   as the URE_BOOTSTRAP variable must be set.

 let
   office = pkgs.libreoffice-fresh-unwrapped;
 in {
   environment.sessionVariables = {
     PYTHONPATH = "${office}/lib/libreoffice/program";
     URE_BOOTSTRAP = "vnd.sun.star.pathname:${office}/lib/libreoffice/program/fundamentalrc";
   };
 }

KDE / Plasma

   If you use KDE (Plasma) then you'll be better off with libreoffice-qt
   package. Otherwise you may lack, e.g. main menu bar.
