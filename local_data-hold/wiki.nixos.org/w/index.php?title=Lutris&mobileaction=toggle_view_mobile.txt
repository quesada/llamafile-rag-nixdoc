   From NixOS Wiki

   Lutris is a video game preservation platform that you can use to play or
   emulate pretty much any game you want.

Adding missing dependencies

   If any games are unable to run due to missing dependencies, they can be
   installed using the following methods.

  Libraries

   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     (lutris.override {
       extraLibraries =  pkgs: [
         # List library dependencies here
       ];
     })
   ];

  Packages

   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     (lutris.override {
        extraPkgs = pkgs: [
          # List package dependencies here
        ];
     })
   ];

Known Issues

  Icons does not appear

   You have to install a compatible icon theme. For example, you can install
   the adwaita-icon-theme available as gnome3.adwaita-icon-theme in Nixpkgs.

  Epic Game Store

   If you're running a 64bit environment you need to ensure that you enable
   32bit support in your configuration.nix: hardware.hardware.enable32Bit =
   true # hardware.opengl.driSupport32Bit in 24.05

  Incompatible Lutris libraries

   When installing some games, you may see a message similar to: mktemp:
   $USER/.local/share/lutris/runtime/steam/amd64/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libattr.so.1:
   version `ATTR_1.3' not found (required by mktemp)

   This happens because lutris attempts to use it's own runtime which has
   incompatible libraries. To disable these potentially conflicting
   libraries: More (three horizontal lines) > Preferences > Global Options >
   Disable Lutris Runtime. Then attempt to install the game or application
   again.
