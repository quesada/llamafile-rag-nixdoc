   From NixOS Wiki

   MPV is an open-source command line media player known for its high
   performance, versatility, and minimalist design.While it has a basic GUI,
   MPV can be paired with a GUI front-end like SMPlayer (package: smplayer)
   to offer a user-friendly interface similar to other desktop media players.

   MPV supports a wide range of video and audio formats, ensuring extensive
   compatibility. It features advanced video rendering capabilities,
   including high-quality scaling algorithms, color management, and HDR
   support, which contribute to superior video playback quality. MPV
   leverages hardware-accelerated video decoding through APIs such as VA-API,
   VDPAU, and DXVA2, improving performance and reducing CPU usage. The
   player’s minimalist design emphasizes efficiency, offering a streamlined
   user experience with extensive configurability through command-line
   options and scripting interfaces.

     pkgs.mpv-unwrapped.wrapper {
       scripts = with pkgs.mpvScripts; [
         uosc
         sponsorblock
       ];

     ytdl-format = "bestvideo+bestaudio";
     cache-default = 4000000;
   };
 };

Tips and Tricks

    Where to get scripts

   To find more scripts run this in a terminal:

 nix search nixpkgs mpvScripts

   The scripts are also defined in the following Nixpkgs directory.

    Where to find override options

   The package override options are defined in the following Nixpkgs
   directory.

Troubleshooting

    Error, unknown format

   If you get the following sort of error, note that MPV currently uses the
   small ffmpeg version (ffmpeg_5) instead of the full version
   (ffmpeg_5-full).

 $ mpv --log-file=foo.log av://v4l2:/dev/video5
 [lavf] Unknown lavf format v4l2
 Failed to recognize file format.

 Exiting... (Errors when loading file)

   To address this problem, you can use the following package configuration
   for ffmpeg.

 programs.mpv = {
   enable = true;

   package = (
     pkgs.mpv-unwrapped.wrapper {
       mpv = pkgs.mpv-unwrapped.override {
         ffmpeg = pkgs.ffmpeg-full;
       };
     }
   );
 };
