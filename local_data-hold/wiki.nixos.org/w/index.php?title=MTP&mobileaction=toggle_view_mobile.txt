   From NixOS Wiki

   The Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) can be used to transfer media files to
   and from many mobile phones (most Windows Phone and Android devices) and
   media players (e.g. Creative Zen).

   MTP devices are usually mounted via FUSE and then appear as a more or less
   regular file system.

   This page lists some ways to mount a MTP device.

    Tip                                                                       
    You usually need to unlock and change the connection mode to "File        
    Transfer" for an Android device to appear as an MTP device                

  jmtpfs

   Install jmtpfs:

 $ nix-env -f "<nixpkgs>" -iA jmtpfs

   To mount the only available device:

 $ mkdir mountpoint
 $ jmtpfs mountpoint

   If there are several connected devices, use -l to find them and -device=
   to specify which one to mount.

   To unmount:

 $ fusermount -u

  gvfs

   On NixOS, file managers that support gvfs, such as PCManFM, can mount mtp
   devices by adding this to configuration.nix:

 {
   services.gvfs.enable = true;
 }

   The above should suffice, but there also exists a more manual method. This
   method apparently only works well with gtk/gnome-based desktops like Gnome
   Shell or Xfce. It relies on having gvfs listed in the environment variable
   GIO_EXTRA_MODULES, for example:

   GIO_EXTRA_MODULES=/nix/store/my9jjhq7s19l05zqk969h69jhrrijpkz-gvfs-1.34.2/lib/gio/modules

   First identify your device with lsusb:

 $ lsusb
 Bus 002 Device 007: ID 1234:5678 The device
 ...

   The adress of the device will then be mtp://[usb:002,007]/.

   You need the gio from the glib package. Then:

 $ gio mount "mtp://[usb:002,007]/"

   to mount and

 $ gio mount -u "mtp://[usb:002,007]/"

   to unmount.

   The device will appear in your favorite file manager.
