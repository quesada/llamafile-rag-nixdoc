   MATLAB (an abbreviation of "matrix laboratory") is a proprietary
   multi-paradigm programming language and numeric computing environment
   developed by MathWorks.[1]

Installation

   Matlab due to it's installation method and licensing is really problematic
   to package into nixpkgs[2], that is why the only way to install it is to
   use some imperative way (to install it outside the nix store).

  (Recommended) Based on Doronbehar [3] repo (with or without flakes)

   You may prefer to use this method by doronbehar. It is based on the one
   described below, but requires less work.

  Based on tviiti[4] repo or custom work (without flakes)

   Firstly you need to download zipped Matlab archive for Linux from the
   official webpage. Then create a folder for the installation files and
   unzip the archive into that folder via unzip -X -K command.

   Then you will need shell.nix file that will create proper FHS environment.
   This shell should use buildFHSUserEnv function and should contain all the
   relevant packages. Personally I have used tviti[5] imperative Matlab
   shell.

     Tip                                                                      
     In case you also want to use tviti work, clone his repo and get into     
     pkgs/matlab. Then run nix-shell and matlab-shell to get into             
     installation environment. More info can be found in his repo[6]          

   Get into the proper environment via nix-shell. Then you can safely start
   Matlab installer by running ./install script in the Matlab installation
   folder. It is strongly preferred to install Matlab somewhere in the user
   home folder.

   After successful installation, you should add Matlab do your
   configuration.nix file. Personally I have used modified tvitii[7] files. I
   have simply switched runPath to the path of freshly installed Matlab
   folder. Then in my configuration.nix I have used his matlab folder like
   so:

 ...
 let
     tviti-matlab = pkgs.callPackage ./matlab { };
 ...
 in {
 ...
     environment.systemPackages = [ ... tviti-matlab.matlab  ... ];
 ...

     Tip                                                                      
     In order to affect your system by your nix-language-specific changes you 
     have to evaluate it, run (as root):                                      
                                                                              
     # nixos-rebuild switch                                                   

   Now you should have matlab in your path and be able to run it via matlab
   command.

    Weird java errors

   In case you have java errors, and you are using tvitii[8] derivation, you
   may need to modify matlab.nix to something like this:

 { common,  buildFHSUserEnv }:
 buildFHSUserEnv {
   name = "matlab";

   targetPkgs = pkgs: with pkgs; common.targetPkgs pkgs;

   runScript = "${common.runPath}/bin/matlab";
 }

  Other possible issues

    I can't see anything

   If you are using Window Manager and Matlab does not display anything, you
   will need to use wmname command (preferably when starting your session).
   Just run wmname LG3D, run Matlab again and the issue should be fixed.

    No hardware support

   There is a great answer about that here on Matlab answers[9].

   Summarizing this answer:

 cd <your_matlab_location>/sys/os/glnxa64/
 sudo mv libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so.6.bak
 sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6  libstdc++.so.6

   You will not have /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6 at the time of following the
   steps, but Matlab will be run in FHS env, and this path will be visible
   for it.
