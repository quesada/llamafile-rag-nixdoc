Plugins

   To use plugins one can use matomo2nix

 matomoPackages = (callPackage (builtins.fetchGit {
   url = "https://git.helsinki.tools/helsinki-systems/matomo2nix";
   ref = "master";
 }) {}) // {
   withPlugins = matomoPkg: pluginPkgs: runCommand "matomo-with-plugins" {} ''
     cp -a ${matomoPkg}/. $out
     find $out -type d -exec chmod 755 {} +
     for i in ${lib.concatStringsSep " " pluginPkgs}; do
       cp -a $i/. $out
