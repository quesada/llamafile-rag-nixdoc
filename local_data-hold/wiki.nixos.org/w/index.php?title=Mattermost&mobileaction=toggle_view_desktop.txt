   Mattermost is an open source, self-hosted Slack-alternative. As an
   alternative to proprietary SaaS messaging, Mattermost brings all your team
   communication into one place, making it searchable and accessible
   anywhere.^[1]

Installation

   Add mattermost to your environment.systemPackages.

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
   mattermost
 ];

Setup

  Mattermost

   To setup Mattermost, you need to enable its service, and provide it with a
   site url.

 services.mattermost = {
   enable = true;
   siteUrl = "https://mattermost.example.com"; # Set this to the URL you will be hosting the site on.
 };

   After a rebuild, Mattermost will now be accessible at
   http://127.0.0.1:8065. To set it up to match your siteUrl, follow the
   Nginx config below.

  Nginx

   While optional, if you are hosting Mattermost alongside other web
   services, or need SSL (https), you will likely want to set up a web server
   like Nginx.

    Installation

   Add nginx to your environment.systemPackages.

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
   mattermost
   nginx
 ];

    Setup

   The following is an example Nginx setup that enables SSL, and configures
   mattermost.example.com to route to Mattermost.

 # Allow ports 80 and 443 for Nginx
 networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts = [ 80 443 ];

 # Set up for SSL certification
 security.acme = {
   acceptTerms = true;
   defaults.email = "webmaster@example.com"; # Replace with your preferred email address.
 };

 # Configure Nginx
 services.nginx = {
   enable = true;
   recommendedProxySettings = true;
   recommendedTlsSettings = true;   
   virtualHosts = {
     # Replace with the domain from your siteUrl
     "mattermost.example.com" = {
       forceSSL = true; # Enforce SSL for the site
       enableACME = true; # Enable SSL for the site
       locations."/" = {
         proxyPass = "http://127.0.0.1:8065"; # Route to Mattermost
         proxyWebsockets = true;
       };
     };
   };
 };

   After a rebuild, Mattermost will now be accessible at siteUrl (assuming
   you have configured your DNS).
