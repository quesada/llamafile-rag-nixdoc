   From NixOS Wiki

   MongoDB is a NoSQL database program.

Installation

   If no extra configuration is needed, you'll only use the following line to
   install and enable MongoDB. This will give you a mongodb with
   authentication disabled, listening on 127.0.0.1 and the database path to
   store the data is /var/db/mongodb.

 ...
 services.mongodb.enable = true;
 ...

   Warning: The default mongodb package does not provide pre-compiled
   binaries, and the package will be compiled locally. The alternate package
   mongodb-ce does however. You can configure the mongodb service to use this
   package with the following:

 services.mongodb.package = pkgs.mongodb-ce;

Configuration

   Here's an example with multiple options. Beware that putting your password
   in cleartext into the config should not be done. Please check Comparison
   of secret managing schemes for that matter.

 services.mongodb = {
   enable = true;
   package = "mongodb-5_0";
   enableAuth = true;
   initialRootPassword = "YourSecurePassword";
   bind_ip = "10.5.0.2";
 };
