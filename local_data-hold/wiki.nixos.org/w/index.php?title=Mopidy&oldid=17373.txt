   Mopidy is an MPD-compatible music server written in Python.

   On NixOS, Mopidy is configured via the services.mopidy options.

Extensions

   Mopidy extensions are installed by adding their package to
   services.mopidy.extensionPackages.

  mopidy-youtube

   By default, the mopidy-youtube extension relies on youtube-dl as the
   backend for downloading from YouTube, but it can be configured to use a
   compatible alternative backend such as yt-dlp. Due to the way Mopidy
   extensions are implemented in nixpkgs, to add another module to the Python
   environment of mopidy-youtube, the mopidy package set must be overridden
   like so:

 services.mopidy = let
   mopidyPackagesOverride = pkgs.mopidyPackages.overrideScope (prev: final: {
     extraPkgs = pkgs: [ pkgs.yt-dlp ];
   });
 in {
   extensionPackages = with mopidyPackagesOverride; [
     mopidy-youtube
   ];
   configuration = ''
     [youtube]
     youtube_dl_package = yt_dlp
   '';
 }
