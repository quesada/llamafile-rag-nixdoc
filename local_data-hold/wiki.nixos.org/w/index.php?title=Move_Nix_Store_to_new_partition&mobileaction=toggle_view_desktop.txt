   The tutorial will teach you how to relocate /nix to a new device on non
   NixOS Hosts. A summary of how this could be done on NixOS is at the
   bottom. This has not been tested on NixOS but there may still be a way:

                               On *BSD/Linux Host

   The device that /nix is on has no more space

 $ du -h
 Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
 /dev/sda1       182G  180G    2G  99% /

   Stop nix daemon

 $ sudo systemctl stop nix-daemon.service

   Move backup /nix; mv /nix to /nix.bak

 $ ls -alF /nix
 total 1068
 drwxr-xr-x    4 root root      4096 Jan 22 02:43 ./
 drwxr-xr-x   26 root root      4096 Feb  8 12:17 ../
 drwxrwxr-t 1555 root nixbld 1077248 Feb  8 12:05 store/
 drwxr-xr-x    4 root root      4096 Jan 22 02:43 var/

 $ cd /
 $ tar -afp /nix.tgz /nix /nix.bak
 $ sudo mv /nix /nix.bak # in case something goes horribly wrong

   Mount new device. You will need to add this device to `/etc/fstab`

 $ mount /nix
 $ du -h
 Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
 /dev/sdb1       300G    0G  300G   0% /nix

   Restore /nix from /nix.tgz; verify contents

 $ cd /
 $ sudo tar -xf /nix.tgz
 $ nix-store --verify --check-contents

   Start nix-daemon

 $ sudo systemctl start nix-daemon.service

    Article Storage Optimization (Discuss in                                  
    Talk:Move_Nix_Store_to_new_partition)                                     

   Add rescue-boot.nix to your imports section.

   nixos-rebuild (and pray you have ~300mb free on /boot/)

   run the installer from grub at any time.

   adjust your configuration.nix so it expects /nix to be at the new place,
   and nixos-rebuild boot, so it doesnt break after you move it

   Now reboot and move it.
