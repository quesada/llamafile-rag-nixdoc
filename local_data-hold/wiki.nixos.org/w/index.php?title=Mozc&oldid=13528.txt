    This article or section needs expansion.                                  
    Reason: This article is a stub. (Discuss in Talk:Mozc#)                   
    Please consult the pedia article metapage for guidelines on contributing. 

   This will enable the `Japanese (Mozc)` entry in Gnome settings.

    i18n = {
      inputMethod = {
        enabled = "ibus";
        ibus.engines = with pkgs.ibus-engines; [ mozc ];
      };
    };
 }
