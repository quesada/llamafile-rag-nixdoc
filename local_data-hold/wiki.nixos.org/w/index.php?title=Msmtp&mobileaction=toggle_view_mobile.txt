   msmtp is a basic email sender client. It is easy to configure but lacks
   some features like queuing when offline.

Installation

   A minimal configuration to relay mails through an external mail server
   coud look like this

   Warning: Do not use a plaintext password in production, this is for
   demonstration only

 programs.msmtp = {
   enable = true;
   accounts.default = {
     host = "example.org";
     from = "hello@example.org";
     user = "hello@example.org";
     password = "mypassword123";
   };
 };

   In this case msmtp will try to deliver mails through the smtp server
   example.org on port 25. user and password are used for normal plaintext
   authentication.

   This configuration will automatically set msmtp as the default mail
   delivery client on your system by overwriting the sendmail binary. To test
   mail delivery issue following command:

 # echo -e "Content-Type: text/plain\r\nSubject: Test\r\n\r\nHello World" | sendmail john.doe@mail.com

   A mail with the subject Test will be sent to the recipient
   john.doe@mail.com including the body text Hello World. A Mime-Header is
   added to the mail content for better compatibility.

Configuration

   Further configuration options for msmtp can be found here.

  TLS connections

 programs.msmtp = {
   enable = true;
   accounts = {
     default = {
       auth = true;
       tls = true;
       # try setting `tls_starttls` to `false` if sendmail hangs
       from = "<from address here>";
       host = "<hostname here>";
       user = "<username here>";
       passwordeval = "cat /secrets/smtp_password.txt";
     };
   };
 };

   Note that msmtp has no daemon and runs as the invoking user. If using
   passwordeval, the file must be readable by any user that wishes to send
   mail.

  Aliases

   Example:

 programs.msmtp.defaults = {
   aliases = "/etc/aliases";
 };

 environment.etc = {
   "aliases" = {
     text = ''
       root: me@example.com
     '';
     mode = "0644";
   };
 };
