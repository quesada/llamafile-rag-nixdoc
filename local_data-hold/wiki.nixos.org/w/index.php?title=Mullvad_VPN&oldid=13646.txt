   Warning: Mullvad VPN currently only works if systemd-resolved is enable.
   More info at this forum post. If this issue is fixed please remove this
   warning banner.

   To install Mullvad VPN, you need to enable it in your system options:

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.mullvad-vpn.enable = true;

   If you want to use the GUI application:

 services.mullvad-vpn.package = pkgs.mullvad-vpn;
