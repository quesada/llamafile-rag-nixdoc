NOTE

   Nixpkgs currently packages PrismLauncher, a fork of MultiMC, which
   currently does not require you, but does allow you, to obtain your own
   client ID. This information is provided mainly for historical interest.

  Using a Microsoft account

   Microsoft authentication requires a client ID, which the package in
   Nixpkgs does not currently contain.

   The MultiMC source contains instructions to create one:

    1. Register an app, following the instructions at
       https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app
       (make sure that you've set up a tenant as mentioned in the
       prerequisites)
    2. Restrict it to personal accounts
    3. Do *not* add a redirect URI, platform, credentials, certificates, or
       client secrets
    4. Enable public client flows
    5. Enable Live SDK support (under authentication)

   You can then override the MultiMC package to include your client ID:

 (multimc.override { msaClientID = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"; })

   If you use home-manager, you can use the following snippet in your
   home-manager config:

   nixpkgs.overlays = [ (self: super: {
     multimc = super.multimc.override {
       msaClientID = "<your application id>";
    };
  }
  ) ];
