   A multiseat system allows for multiple separate simultaneous users on one
   machine. NixOS supports multiseat using udev, loginctl and assigning
   separate hardware to each seat, with at least one video card per seat. For
   that you need to properly configure udev to assign hardware to each seat.

   On a traditional Linux distribution you can use the loginctl attach
   command to interactively assign hardware to seats, but since
   /etc/udev/rules.d is read-only in NixOS (even with mutable /etc) this is
   not possible. You can either create the udev rules by hand if you know how
   to or use a traditional distro to interactively create them using loginctl
   attach and loginctl seat-status , then copy them. The loginctl generated
   rules should be in /etc/udev/rules.d/72-seat-*. Remember to assign inputs,
   sound, and all parts of the video card(likely a DRM framebuffer, graphics
   proper and sound).

   Then you can add the rules to udev in configuration.nix. Example:

   environment.etc.seat = {
     target = "udev/rules.d/72-myrules.rules";
     text = ''
       TAG=="seat", ENV{ID_FOR_SEAT}=="drm-pci-0000_06_00_0", ENV{ID_SEAT}="seat1"
       TAG=="seat", ENV{ID_FOR_SEAT}=="graphics-pci-0000_06_00_0", ENV{ID_SEAT}="seat1"
       TAG=="seat", ENV{ID_FOR_SEAT}=="sound-pci-0000_06_00_1", ENV{ID_SEAT}="seat1"
       TAG=="seat", ENV{ID_FOR_SEAT}=="usb-pci-0000_02_00_0-usb-0_8", ENV{ID_SEAT}="seat1"
       TAG=="seat", ENV{ID_FOR_SEAT}=="usb-pci-0000_02_00_0-usb-0_9", ENV{ID_SEAT}="seat1"
     '';
   };

   The display manager should automatically show the login screen on each
   separate seat after a reboot. Tested with LightDM.
