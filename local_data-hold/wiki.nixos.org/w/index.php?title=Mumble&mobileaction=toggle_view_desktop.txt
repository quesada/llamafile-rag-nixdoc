   From NixOS Wiki

   Mumble is an open source voice chat application.

                                 Install client

   To install the Mumble client it is needed to install a package:

   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     mumble
   ];

PulseAudio Support

   Add the following to your configuration.nix for pulseaudio support:

 { config, pkgs, ...}:
 {
   environment.systemPackages = [
     (pkgs.mumble.override { pulseSupport = true; })
   ];
 }

                             Install Murmur server

   Murmur is the server service for Mumble clients. It can be enabled and has
   several options available.

   services.murmur = {
     enable = true;
     openFirewall = true;
   };

   The initial password for the user SuperUser is written in the slog table
   in the sqlite database: /var/lib/murmur/murmur.sqlite
