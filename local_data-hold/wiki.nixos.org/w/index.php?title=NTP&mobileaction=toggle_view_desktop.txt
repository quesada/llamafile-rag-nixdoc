   NTP is a protocol to synchronise time and date information through a
   network. It is used to set the clock of your system automatically when
   your computer is connected to the internet.

NTP servers

   To choose which servers to ask for time information to, use the
   networking.timeServers option. If you simply want to add a server to the
   default list, you can retrieve the default value of the option under the
   name options.networking.timeServers.default. Make sure to have options in
   the arguments at the beginning of the file:

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 { pkgs, lib, options, ...}
 {
   networking.timeServers = options.networking.timeServers.default ++ [ "ntp.example.com" ];
 }

    Tip                                                                       
    In order to affect your system by your nix-language-specific changes you  
    have to evaluate it, run (as root):                                       
                                                                              
    # nixos-rebuild switch                                                    

NTP daemon

   Different NTP daemons are available on NixOS. The default one is
   systemd-timesyncd. To switch to another implementation:

     * for ntpd, use services.ntp.enable = true;
     * for openntpd, use services.openntpd.enable = true;
     * for chrony, use services.chrony.enable = true;

Set NTP from DHCP servers

   Most of the time the default NTP servers will be reachable. However,
   sometimes the NTP servers can be blocked by the firewall (for instance
   most universities block NTP for security reasons). This will be visible in
   the systemd-timesyncd.service:

 $ sudo systemctl status systemd-timesyncd.service
 ● systemd-timesyncd.service - Network Time Synchronization
 …
 nov. 22 16:33:23 me systemd-timesyncd[2171]: Timed out waiting for reply from 94.198.159.11:123 (1.nixos.pool.ntp.org).
 …

   You can also test a specific server as follows:

 $ nix-shell -p ntp
 $ ntpdate -q 0.nixos.pool.ntp.org
 22 Nov 17:06:57 ntpdate[4020886]: no server suitable for synchronization found

   However, a replacement NTP is usually provided in that case via the DHCP
   protocol. You can see it for instance if you use Network Manager:

 $ nmcli connection show 'name-of-the-current-connection' | grep ntp
 DHCP4.OPTION[8]:                        ntp_servers = 192.168.x.y
 DHCP4.OPTION[18]:                       requested_ntp_servers = 1
 $ ntpdate -q 192.168.x.y
 server 192.168.x.y, stratum 3, offset +2.493988, delay 0.02779
 22 Nov 16:51:37 ntpdate[3923570]: step time server 192.168.128.1 offset +2.493988 sec

   You might also be able to get the actual hostname of the DHCP (if it
   exists) using:

 $ sudo nmap -sP 192.168.x.y

   Then, you can of course manually add the DHCP server as explained above…
   but it's not practical when you often go to new places, or if the NTP
   server changes over time. For laptop it may not be a big issue (your
   internal clock will be used in that case until you reach a new network
   without firewalls) but for some devices like raspberry pi that can't store
   the time when device is turned off, or for servers that will always be
   behind the firewall, it can be interesting to automatically configure the
   NTP server using DHCP.

   The procedure depends on how you configure internet:

    1. By default: (if you have not installed network manager…) the module
       network-interfaces-scripted will be used… unfortunately as far as I
       know this script cannot deal with NTP.
    2. networkd: If you use systemd-networkd, then it should automatically
       use the right NTP… However if you want the configuration to be
       automatic you want to use networking.useNetworkd = true; instead of
       systemd.network.enable (useNetworkd will automatically configure
       systemd.network to provide a good default experience as alone
       systemd.network does basically nothing). However,
       networking.useNetworkd is apparently experimental now (2022) according
       to its documentation, so use it at your own risks. As far as I
       understand you can also disable the default behavior using:

 systemd.network.config = {
   dhcpV4Config = { UseNTP = false; };
   dhcpV6Config = { UseNTP = false; };
 }

       but I have not tested it.

    3. Network Manager If you use Network Manager, then Network Manager
       cannot (in 2022) automatically configure the NTP as-it… but you can
       use this trick to fake it, by automatically creating a new
       connection-specific NTP configuration every time the connection
       changes and restarting systemd-timesyncd.service:

 # In /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
 { pkgs, lib, options, ...}
 {
   ## To use, put this in your configuration, switch to it, and restart NM:
   ## $ sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service
   ## To check if it works, you can do `sudo systemctl status systemd-timesyncd.service`
   ## (it may take a bit of time to pick the right NTP as it may try the
   ## other NTP firsts)
   networking.networkmanager.dispatcherScripts = [
     {
       # https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NetworkManager#Dynamically_set_NTP_servers_received_via_DHCP_with_systemd-timesyncd
       # You can debug with sudo journalctl -u NetworkManager-dispatcher -e
       # make sure to restart NM as described above
       source = pkgs.writeText "10-update-timesyncd" ''
         [ -z "$CONNECTION_UUID" ] && exit 0
         INTERFACE="$1"
         ACTION="$2"
         case $ACTION in
         up | dhcp4-change | dhcp6-change)
             systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd.service
             if [ -n "$DHCP4_NTP_SERVERS" ]; then
               echo "Will add the ntp server $DHCP4_NTP_SERVERS"
             else
               echo "No DHCP4 NTP available."
               exit 0
             fi
             mkdir -p /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf.d
             # <<-EOF must really use tabs to keep indentation correct… and tabs are often converted to space in wiki
             # so I don't want to risk strange issues with indentation
             echo "[Time]" > "/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf.d/''${CONNECTION_UUID}.conf"
             echo "NTP=$DHCP4_NTP_SERVERS" >> "/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf.d/''${CONNECTION_UUID}.conf"
             systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd.service
             ;;
         down)
             rm -f "/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf.d/''${CONNECTION_UUID}.conf"
             systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd.service
             ;;
         esac
         echo 'Done!'
       '';
     }
   ];
 }

       To apply the change, switch to your new configuration and make sure to
       restart Network Manager:

 $ sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service

       Check if the NTP server is used (may need to wait a few minutes):

 $ sudo systemctl status systemd-timesyncd.service

       You might need to wait a one or two minutes as systemd-timesyncd may
       try to load other ntp servers, timeout, and then try the new NTP
       server.
