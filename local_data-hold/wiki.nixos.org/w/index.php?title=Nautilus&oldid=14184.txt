   Nautilus is the GNOME desktop's file manager. When using Nautilus without
   GNOME, you may need to enable additional services to get familiar
   functionality.

Configuration

  GVfs

   If GVfs is not available, you may see errors such as "Sorry, could not
   display all the contents of “trash:///”: Operation not supported" when
   trying to open the trash folder, or be unable to access network
   filesystems.

   To enable GVfs:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.gvfs.enable = true;

   Then log out and back in, and verify that the GIO_EXTRA_MODULES
   environment variable is set.

   When using X11, this is probably sufficient (though, see the general notes
   on running GNOME programs outside of GNOME). On Wayland, more effort may
   be required: [1].

  Gstreamer

   Unless you've installed Gstreamer plugins system-wide, the "Audio and
   Video Properties" pane under the "Properties" menu for media files will
   say "Oops! Something went wrong. Your GStreamer installation is missing a
   plug-in."

   To enable the A/V Properties and see details like media length, codec,
   etc, the following overlay may be used:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 nixpkgs.overlays = [(self: super: {
   gnome = super.gnome.overrideScope' (gself: gsuper: {
     nautilus = gsuper.nautilus.overrideAttrs (nsuper: {
       buildInputs = nsuper.buildInputs ++ (with gst_all_1; [
         gst-plugins-good
         gst-plugins-bad
       ]);
     });
   });
 })];

  HEIC image preview

   To enable HEIC image preview in Nautilus, add following to your system
   configuration

 environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.libheif pkgs.libheif.out ];
 environment.pathsToLink = [ "share/thumbnailers" ];
