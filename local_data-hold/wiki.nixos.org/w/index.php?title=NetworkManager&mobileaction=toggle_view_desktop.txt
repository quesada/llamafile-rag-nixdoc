   From NixOS Wiki

   NetworkManager is a program for configuring network devices on Linux. It
   is widely used by several Linux distributions and can be optionally
   enabled on NixOS for non-declarative network configuration. It also tends
   to be the default for many desktop environments, such as GNOME or KDE
   Plasma.

Installation

   NetworkManager can be enabled in the NixOS configuration file with the
   following line:

 networking.networkmanager.enable = true;

   In order to allow access to the NetworkManager daemon and be able to
   configure and add new networks, the user must be added to the
   networkmanager group. This can be done through the extraGroups option for
   a defined user:

 users.users.<name>.extraGroups = [ "networkmanager" ];

   By default, NetworkManager comes with nmcli and nmtui as user interfaces,
   however, a GTK interface called nm-connection-editor can be found in the
   nm-applet package.

Usage

   NetworkManager can be used with several front ends, such as nmcli, nmtui,
   or nm-applet and nm-connection-editor.

Configuration

   The NixOS modules offer additional configurations that can be setup very
   easily.

  DNS Management

   To allow custom DNS management, you must disable NetworkManager's built-in
   DNS resolution, as well as some NixOS dhcp related options. Refer to the
   configuration below as an example of what to do:

 networking.networkmanager.enable = true;

 # Disable NetworkManager's internal DNS resolution
 networking.networkmanager.dns = "none";

 # These options are unnecessary when managing DNS ourselves
 networking.useDHCP = false;
 networking.dhcpcd.enable = false;

 # Configure DNS servers manually (this example uses Cloudflare and Google DNS)
 # IPv6 DNS servers can be used here as well.
 networking.nameservers = [
   "1.1.1.1"
   "1.0.0.1"
   "8.8.8.8"
   "8.8.4.4"
 ];

  Power Saving

   On laptops, where extra power savings may be desired, you can enable
   NetworkManager specific power saving options as follows:

 networking.networkmanager.wifi.powersave = true;

   Please see Power Management for more tips relating to power-saving tips
   and tricks for NixOS.
