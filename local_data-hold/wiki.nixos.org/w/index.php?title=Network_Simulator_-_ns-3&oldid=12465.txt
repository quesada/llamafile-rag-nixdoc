   This is for discrete-event network simulator ns-3.

Developing with ns-3

   ns-3 heavily relies on way for running simulations (examples, tutorials,
   etc.), but we can start developing using a simple Makefile and a
   shell.nix. We will use hello-simulator.cc for this example.

   First create a shell.nix, with the requirements to compile our simulation.

 with import <nixpkgs> {};

 mkShell {
   nativeBuildInputs = [
     llvmPackages_latest.clang
     pkg-config
   ];
   buildInputs = [ ns-3 ];
 }

   Then we can create our Makefile, do note the LIBS argument, which is the
   modules required (not all are build by default, might have to override
   some settings in ns-3).

 # the compiler: gcc for C program, define as g++ for C++
 CC = clang++

 DEBUG=-DNS3_LOG_ENABLE

 LIBS = libns3-dev-core-debug

 # compiler flags:
 #  -g    adds debugging information to the executable file
 #  -Wall turns on most, but not all, compiler warnings
 CFLAGS  = -g -Wall -Wextra $(shell pkg-config --cflags $(LIBS))
 LDFLAGS=$(shell pkg-config --libs $(LIBS))

 # the build target executable:
 TARGET = hello-simulator

 all: $(TARGET)

 $(TARGET): $(TARGET).cc
         $(CC) $(DEBUG) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) -o $(TARGET) $(TARGET).cc

 clean:
         $(RM) $(TARGET)

   Then just place hello-simulator.cc in the same directory as the other
   files, then run the following commands.

 $ nix-shell
 $ make
 $ ./hello-simulator

   Please keep in mind our flag when we compile, regarding debug
   NS3_LOG_ENABLE.
