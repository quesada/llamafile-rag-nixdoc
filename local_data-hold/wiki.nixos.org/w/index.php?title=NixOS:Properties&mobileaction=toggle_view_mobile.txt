   From NixOS Wiki

   Properties are used to scope option definitions with control flow
   statements which do not break (example) the highly recursive process of
   merging modules. All properties are defined in lib/modules.nix.

     * mkNotdef: Invalidate a definition. Any attribute which has this value
       is considered as not defined in the current module.
     * mkIf condition definitions: Create a conditional statements around
       multiple definitions. The definitions are considered only if the
       condition is verified.
     * mkOverrideTemplate priority template definitions: Set a priority level
       to all definitions which are enumerated inside the template. Only
       definitions with the lower priority level are kept. The default
       priority level is 100. An empty template is considered as all
       definitions.
     * mkOverride priority template definitions: Currently the same as
       mkOverrideTemplate.
     * mkDefaultValue definitions: A shortcut notation to define default
       values (priority level of 1000) inside the configuration. This is
       extremely useful to avoid references to properties inside the user
       configuration while overriding the default value of the option. Any
       option define without this property will take precedence over it.
     * mkOrder rank definitions: Add a rank value to definitions. This is
       useful for options where some dependences between definitions exist. A
       lower rank will add the definitions among the first definitions. The
       default rank is 1000.
