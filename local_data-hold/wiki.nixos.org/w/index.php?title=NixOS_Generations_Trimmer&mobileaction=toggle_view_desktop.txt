Overview

   The normal options available in NixOS to cleanup old generations might be
   too limiting. The script below is interactive and smart.

   By default (run with no arguments), the script keeps the last 7 days of
   generations and will prompt you to remove older generations if they are
   more than 10 generations behind the current one. So it always keeps at
   least 10 generations and always preserves generations from the last week.

   You can specify the number of days to always keep generations, and you can
   specify the number of generations to always keep.

   By default, it works on the default profile for the user running it.

   Other profile options:

     * If you are root, you can run on the system profile
     * If you are a normal user, you can run on either the home-manager or
       channels profiles too.

Script (trim-generations.sh)

   The script is available here: Github Gist - NixOS: trim-generations.sh

Example script output

  Without parameters (defaults)

 ❯ ./trim-generations.sh   

 The current defaults are:

 Keep these defaults? (y/n):y
 Using defaults..
 Keeping default: 30 generations OR 30 days, whichever is more

 Do you want to delete these? [Y/n]:

  With parameters

 ❯ ./trim-generations.sh 3 0 home-manager
 OK!      Keep Gens = 3   Keep Days = 0

 Operating on profile:    /nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/user/home-manager

 oldest generation:             58
 oldest generation created:     2021-09-24
 minutes before now:            3922
 hours before now:              65
 days before now:               2

 current generation:            65

         Something to do...

 Found the following generation(s) to delete:
 generation 58    2021-09-24, 2 day(s) old
 generation 59    2021-09-25, 1 day(s) old

 generation 61    2021-09-25, 1 day(s) old
 generation 62    2021-09-25, 1 day(s) old

 Do you want to delete these? [Y/n]:

  With parameters (not enough though)

   Example if you accidentally don't specify all parameters / arguments.

 ❯ sudo ./trim-generations.sh 2 0

 Error: Not enough arguments.

 Usage:
          ./trim-generations.sh <keep-gernerations> <keep-days> <profile>


 (defaults are: Keep-Gens=30 Keep-Days=30 Profile=user)

 If you enter any parameters, you must enter all three, or none to use defaults.
 Example:
          trim-generations.sh 15 10 home-manager
   this will work on the home-manager profile and keep all generations from the
 last 10 days, and keep at least 15 generations no matter how old.

 Profiles available are: user, home-manager, channels, system (root)

 -h or --help prints this help text.

  Run as root (default)

 ❯ sudo ./trim-generations.sh                
 The current defaults are:
  Keep-Gens=30 Keep-Days=30

 Keep these defaults? (y/n):y
 Using defaults..
 Keeping default: 30 generations OR 30 days, whichever is more
 Operating on profile:    /nix/var/nix/profiles/system

 oldest generation:             65
 oldest generation created:     2023-08-05
 minutes before now:            46727
 hours before now:              778
 days before now:               32

 current generation:            102
 current generation created:    2023-09-04
 minutes before now:            3527
 hours before now:              58
 days before now:               2

 All generations are no more than 30 days older than current generation.
 Oldest gen days difference from current gen: 30

         Nothing to do!

  Run as root (on system profile)

 ❯ sudo ./trim-generations.sh 2 0 system
 OK!      Keep Gens = 2   Keep Days = 0

 Operating on profile:    /nix/var/nix/profiles/system

 oldest generation:             11
 oldest generation created:     2021-09-22
 minutes before now:            6807
 hours before now:              113
 days before now:               4

 current generation:            12
 current generation created:    2021-09-26

 Oldest generation (11) is only 1 generations behind current (12).        Nothing to do!

  Run as root (wrong profile)

   Example if you accidentally give wrong profile (no home-manager on root):

 ❯ sudo ./trim-generations.sh 3 0 home-manager

 Error: Do not understand your third argument. Should be one of: (user / system)

 Usage:
          ./trim-generations.sh <keep-gernerations> <keep-days> <profile>


 (defaults are: Keep-Gens=30 Keep-Days=30 Profile=user)

 If you enter any parameters, you must enter all three, or none to use defaults.
 Example:
          trim-generations.sh 15 10 home-manager
   this will work on the home-manager profile and keep all generations from the
 last 10 days, and keep at least 15 generations no matter how old.

 Profiles available are: user, home-manager, channels, system (root)

 -h or --help prints this help text.
