   From NixOS Wiki

   This guide is a companion guide for the official manual. It describes
   installation of NixOS as a complete operating system. For installation of
   Nix within an existing operating system, see Nix Installation Guide.

   In addition to describing the steps from the official manual, it provides
   known good instructions for common use cases. When there is a discrepancy
   between the manual and this guide, the supported case is the one described
   in the manual.

   Use this guide as a step-by-step guide, choices will be presented, use
   only the selected section, and continue at the section it tells you to at
   the end.

Installation target

   NixOS can be installed on an increasing variety of hardware:

     * regular (Intel or AMD) desktop computers, laptops or physically
       accessible servers, covered on this page
     * SBCs (like the Raspberry Pis) and other ARM boards, see NixOS on ARM
     * cloud and remote servers, see NixOS friendly hosters

Installation method

   NixOS, as with most Linux-based operating systems, can be installed in
   different ways.

    1. The classic way, booting from the installation media. (Described
       below.)
    2. Booting the media from an existing Linux installation

Making the installation media

   Since NixOS 14.11 the installer ISO is hybrid. This means it is bootable
   on both CD and USB drives. It also boots on EFI systems, like most modern
   motherboards and apple systems. The following instructions will assume the
   standard way of copying the image to a USB drive. When using a CD or DVD,
   the usual methods to burn to disk should work with the iso.

  "Burning" to USB drive

   First, download a NixOS ISO image or create a custom ISO. Then plug in a
   USB stick large enough to accommodate the image. Then follow the platform
   instructions:

    From Linux

    1. Find the right device with lsblk or fdisk -l. Replace /dev/sdX with
       the proper device in the following steps.
    2. Copy to device: cp nixos-xxx.iso /dev/sdX
   Note: do not use /dev/sdX1 or partitions of the disk, use the whole disk
   /dev/sdX.

   Writing the disk image with dd if=nixos.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M
   status=progress conv=fdatasync also works.

    From macOS

    1. Find the right device with diskutil list, let's say diskX.
    2. Unmount with diskutil unmountDisk diskX.
    3. Burn with: sudo dd if=path_to_nixos.iso of=/dev/diskX

    Tip                                                                       
    Using rdiskX instead of diskX can makes a large speed difference. You can 
    check the write speed with iostat 2 in another terminal.                  

    From Windows

    1. Download USBwriter.
    2. Start USBwriter.
    3. Choose the downloaded ISO as 'Source'
    4. Choose the USB drive as 'Target'
    5. Click 'Write'
    6. When USBwriter has finished writing, safely unplug the USB drive.

  Alternative installation media instructions

   The previous methods are the supported methods of making the USB
   installation media.

   Those methods are also documented, they can allow using the USB drive to
   boot multiple distributions. This is not supported, your mileage may vary.

     * Using Unetbootin
     * Manual USB Creation
     * multibootusb

Booting the installation media

    This article or section needs expansion.                                  
    Reason: Troubleshooting steps, and details are lacking. (Discuss in       
    Talk:NixOS Installation Guide#)                                           
    Please consult the pedia article metapage for guidelines on contributing. 

   Since the installation media is hybrid, it will boot both in legacy bios
   mode and UEFI mode.

   Whatever mode is used to boot the installation media, your motherboard or
   computer's configuration may need to be changed to allow booting from a
   Optical Disk Drive (for CD/DVD) or an external USB drive.

  Legacy bios boot

   This is the only boot possible on machines lacking EFI/UEFI.

  UEFI boot

   The EFI bootloader of the installation media is not signed and is not
   using a signed shim to boot. This means that Secure Boot will need to be
   disabled to boot.

Connecting to the internet

   The installation will definitely need a working internet connection. It is
   possible to install without one, but the available set of packages is
   limited.

  Wired

   For network interfaces supported by the kernel, DHCP resolution should
   already have happened once the shell is available.

Tethered (Internet Sharing)

   If you can not connect to the internet via cable or wifi, you may use
   smartphone's tethering capability to share internet. Depending on your
   smartphones capabilities, only stock kernel drivers may be required which
   can help providing a working network connection.

  Wireless

   Network Manager is installed on the graphical ISO, meaning that it is
   possible to use nmtui on the command line to connect to a network.

   Using the "Applications" tab at top left or the launcher bar at bottom,
   choose a terminal application and from there launch nmtui. This will allow
   you to 'activate' a (wireless) connection - your local SSIDs should be
   visible in the list, else you can add a new connection. When the wireless
   connection is active and you have tested it, it is likely the install app
   which launched on startup has not detected the new connection. Close down
   the install app, and reopen it from the launcher bar at the bottom of the
   screen. This should then find the new connection and proceed.

   On the minimal ISO, or if you are more familiar with wpa_supplicant then
   you can also run wpa_passphrase ESSID | sudo tee /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf,
   then enter your password and systemctl restart wpa_supplicant.

Partitioning

   To partition the persistent storage run sudo fdisk /dev/diskX and follow
   instructions for DOS or (U)EFI. A very simple example setup is given here.

  DOS

     * o (dos disk label)
     * n new
     * p primary (4 primary in total)
     * 1 (partition number [1/4])
     * 2048 first sector (alignment for performance)
     * +500M last sector (boot sector size)
     * rm signature (Y), if ex. => warning of overwriting existing system,
       could use wipefs
     * n
     * p
     * 2
     * default (fill up partition)
     * default (fill up partition)
     * w (write)

  UEFI

     * g (gpt disk label)
     * n
     * 1 (partition number [1/128])
     * 2048 first sector
     * +500M last sector (boot sector size)
     * t
     * 1 (EFI System)
     * n
     * 2
     * default (fill up partition)
     * default (fill up partition)
     * w (write)

Label partitions

   This is useful for having multiple setups and makes partitions easier to
   handle

 $ lsblk
 $ sudo mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/sdX1
 $ sudo fatlabel /dev/sdX1 NIXBOOT
 $ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX2 -L NIXROOT
 $ sudo mount /dev/disk/by-label/NIXROOT /mnt
 $ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/boot
 $ sudo mount /dev/disk/by-label/NIXBOOT /mnt/boot

Swap file

 $ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/.swapfile bs=1024 count=2097152 (2GB size)
 $ sudo chmod 600 /mnt/.swapfile
 $ sudo mkswap /mnt/.swapfile
 $ sudo swapon /mnt/.swapfile

NixOS config

 $ sudo nixos-generate-config --root /mnt
 $ cd /mnt/etc/nixos/
 $ sudo vim configuration.nix

   Most essential changes:

     * keyboard layout, ie services.xserver.xkb.layout
     * users.users.user with adding entry initialPassword = "pw123";
     * networking (wifi), see below for fix if it breaks
     * boot.loader.grub.device = "/dev/sda"; #or "nodev" for efi only
     * install editor to edit the configuration
     * change hardware config to use labels

   The self-documenting NixOS options can be searched with NixOS options
   search.

NixOS installation

 $ cd /mnt
 $ sudo nixos-install

   after installation: Run passwd to change user password. if internet
   broke/breaks, try one of the following:

 $ nixos-rebuild switch --option substitute false # no downloads
 $ nixos-rebuild switch --option binary-caches "" # no downloads

     * wpa_supplicant flags to connect to wifi

Additional notes for specific hardware

   These are collected notes or links for specific hardware issues.

     * Blog post how to install NixOS on a Dell 9560
     * Brand servers may require extra kernel modules be included into initrd
       (boot.initrd.extraKernelModules in configuration.nix) For example HP
       Proliant needs "hpsa" module to see the disk drive.
