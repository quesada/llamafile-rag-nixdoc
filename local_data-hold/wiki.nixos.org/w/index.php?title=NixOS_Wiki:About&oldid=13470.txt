What?

   The NixOS Wiki is a community-run documentation resource for NixOS users.

   NixOS is a Linux distribution based on the Nix package manager and the
   Nixpkgs software repository. All three are part of the Nix ecosystem.

Why?

   Reference documentation in NixOS manual, Nixpkgs manual, Nix manual is
   maintained with the source code, can be used for looking up technical
   details, and primarily serves the needs of power users, developers, and
   contributors. The introductory guides on nix.dev are meant to help getting
   started with Nix on other Linux distributions.

   These primary resources are actively developed, but cannot possibly
   account for the full spectrum of use cases NixOS supports. The NixOS Wiki
   is there for users to collect practical guides, configuration examples,
   and troubleshooting tips.

   See the history of NixOS wikis for background information.
