   From NixOS Wiki

Introduction

   At wiki.nixos.org, we regard your privacy as important, same as we regard
   our own privacy. This policy provides information about how we collect,
   use, and safeguard your personal data when you interact with our website.

Information We Collect

  Log Data

   Whenever you visit wiki.nixos.org, our servers automatically record
   certain information, referred to as "log data." This includes specifics
   that your browser transmits to us, such as your Internet Protocol address,
   the URL you accessed on our site, your browser type, and the date and time
   of your request. It also incorporates data about your usage of nixos.wiki
   and any cookie data.

  Cookies

   wiki.nixos.org uses "cookies" or equivalent technologies to capture data.
   Cookies are small text files that your computer sends each time you visit
   our website. Depending on their function, we may use session cookies
   (which expire when you close your browser) or persistent cookies (which
   remain on your device until you or your browser delete them).

   We use cookies to remember your preferences and settings on
   wiki.nixos.org, thus saving you from the need to set them up each time you
   visit our site. Some cookies may be linked to your wiki.nixos.org account,
   which might include information like the email address or username you
   provided us, while others are not. Our usage of cookies is consistent with
   standard practices for MediaWiki installations. We refrain from using
   cookies for additional user tracking or advertising purposes.

  Wiki Data

   Given the intrinsic nature of a wiki and especially the MediaWiki
   software, we must save and process specific additional data. This includes
   (but is not limited to) your wiki username, language settings, email
   address (if provided), a log of all your wiki edits, and the time, date,
   and associated account of each edit.

Requesting Removal of Your Personal Data

   If you want your personal data removed from wiki.nixos.org, please reach
   out to us at wiki@nixos.org. Make sure to specify:

     * The precise personal information you want us to remove. Providing as
       many details as possible will help avoid unnecessary correspondence.
     * A method for us to verify that the data you wish to have removed
       indeed belongs to you.

   Please note:

     * We can't process requests that lack the required information.
     * Certain data is essential for the proper functioning of the wiki and,
       under the legitimate interest provision, will not be removed. This
       includes your wiki username, for instance.

Contacting Us

   Should you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, feel
   free to contact our admin team at wiki@nixos.org. Our admin team consists
   entirely of volunteers, and all work is carried out on a best-effort
   basis. As such, we can't guarantee immediate response times.

   By using our site, you consent to the terms of this privacy policy. We may
   occasionally update this policy, so we recommend you review it regularly
   to stay informed about our data practices
