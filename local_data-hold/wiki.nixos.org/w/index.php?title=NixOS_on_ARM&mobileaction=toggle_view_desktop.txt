   NixOS supports 64-bit ARM.

   The support level for ARM overall varies depending on the architecture and
   the specific ecosystems and boards.

   The way the ARM integration is built into NixOS is by making generic
   builds the first-class citizens. This means that as soon as there is
   upstream support for the board in the kernel and platform firmware, NixOS
   should work once those are updated.

   It is still possible, when needed, to build and use a customized platform
   firmware and kernel for specific boards^[reference needed].

   At this moment in time (early 2024) only AArch64 has full support
   upstream. With that said, neither armv6l or armv7l are being ignored,
   fixes are worked on and approved as needed. What's missing is support and
   builds being maintained in binary form. At the time of writing, no
   publicly available caches for armv6l or armv7l are available.

  Upstream (NixOS) supported devices

   NixOS has support for these boards using AArch64 architecture on the
   nixpkgs-unstable and stable channel.

   Support for those board assumes as much is supported as Mainline Linux
   supports.

  Community supported devices

   These boards are not routinely verified as working.

   The baseline support level expected is “Just as much as mainline Linux and
   U-Boot supports them”, except if specified otherwise.

Troubleshooting

  Hanging at Starting kernel ...

   When booting a NixOS system, it may look like it is hung at Starting
   kernel ....

   It is unlikely to be hung at this part. This is the last message printed
   by U-Boot. U-Boot prints to both the display and the console at once.

   To view the kernel messages and boot output, the “stdout” of the kernel
   needs to be configured appropriately.

   The kernel's stdout will differ depending on semantics.

     * When there are no valid console= kernel command-line arguments, it
       will default to the /chosen/stdout-path device tree property.
       (Generally a serial console.)
     * When valid console= parameters are present, the kernel picks the
       leftmost valid one as stdout.

   In other words, the solution may be to enable the appropriate console=
   parameters according to your hardware configuration and system.

     * For the display, add console=tty0.
     * For a serial console, refer to the target device configuration.

  Details about the boot process

   NixOS can also be booted through UEFI on ARM. The semantics are generally
   the same as on other architectures. Do note that the common use of Device
   Tree instead of ACPI in consumer-class hardware may make this a bit more
   awkward.

   Otherwise, in SBC-class hardware, it is common that boards are generally
   expected to use U-Boot as the platform firmware and bootloader. See the
   section about using NixOS with U-Boot.

Binary caches

  AArch64

   The official NixOS Hydra instance builds a full set of binaries (available
   on https://cache.nixos.org) for the AArch64 architecture on the
   nixpkgs-unstable and stable channels.

  armv6l and armv7l

   Some users have provided best effort caches in the past for 32 bit ARM,
   but none are currently available.

Getting Support

   There is a dedicated room for the upstream NixOS effort on Matrix,
   #nixos-on-arm:nixos.org.

   Don't hesitate to ask questions. Note that reply times may vary greatly,
   depending on the provided information.
