   From NixOS Wiki

   This article provides an overview of the Nix Community, to give an idea of
   who we — the users and maintainers of the Nix Ecosystem — are. To find the
   various ways to reach us, see get in touch.

People

   Nix Ecosystem users and contributors are a mixed bunch, ranging from
   hobbyist to professional, from industry to academia. Typical user groups
   include:

     * desktop users using Nix and NixOS to make life on their personal
       machines easier;
     * power users duplicating their environment across their personal and
       work machines;
     * gamers using NixOS to declaratively configure unbreakable and sharable
       gaming setups;
     * developers using Nix to reproducibly build their software, and to
       manage various development environments;
     * system administrators declaratively configuring servers and clusters
       with NixOS and NixOps;
     * researchers interested in making the computation in their research
       reproducible.

Institutions

  NixOS Foundation

   The NixOS Foundation is responsible for providing operational and
   organizational support to the Nix Ecosystem and community. It also funds
   the official Hydra instance which builds the Nixpkgs collection.

  Academia

   Nix has its roots in academia; Nix was the result of Eelco Dolstra's PhD
   thesis in the University of Utrecht, and Hydra was developed at the
   Technical University of Delft. Some academic research continues to develop
   the Nix Ecosystem further - notably some work is planned on incremental
   builds by Guillaume Maudoux as part of his PhD.

   Nix is also being extensively used to manage powerful computing clusters,
   since its resolution of dependency problems allows letting users install
   packages ad-hoc with greatly reduced risk of breaking things. Academic
   clusters utilizing Nix-based software include some of the biggest clusters
   in the world:

     * Human Brain Project
     * Blue Brain Project
