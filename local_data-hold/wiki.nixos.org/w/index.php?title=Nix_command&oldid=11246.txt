   This article is about the new nix command and all of its subcommands. The
   new nix command is intended to unify many different Nix package manager
   utilities that exist currently as many separate commands, eg. nix-build,
   nix-shell, etc.

   See the Nix manual for a complete reference.

Enabling the nix command

   In nix 2.4 the nix command must be enabled explicitly set. You can do this
   in a few different ways.

   For an individual invocation, eg.

 nix --experimental-features nix-command build ...

   Or by setting a user-specific configuration,

 # ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
 experimental-features = nix-command

   in ~/.config/nix/nix.conf.

   On NixOS you can't edit /etc/nix/nix.conf directly, but you can enable
   this feature by editing /etc/nixos/configuration.nix:

 #
 { pkgs, ... }: {
   …
   nix.settings.experimental-features = [ "nix-command" ];
   …
 }

   and then run sudo nixos-rebuild switch as always.

Switching between nix-env and nix profile

   Warning: Be careful when testing. Once you have used nix profile you can
   no longer use nix-env without first deleting
   /nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/$USER/profile

   Once you installed a package with nix profile, you get the following error
   message when using nix-env:

 $ nix-env -f '<nixpkgs>' -iA 'hello'
 error: --- Error ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- nix-env
 profile '/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/joerg/profile' is incompatible with 'nix-env'; please use 'nix profile' instead

   To migrate back to nix-env you can delete your current profile:

   Warning: This will delete packages that have been installed before, so you
   may want to back this information before running the command.

 $ rm -rf /nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/$USER/profile

New equivalents to old commands

 # create a store derivation for a package defined in the current directory's default.nix
 old$ nix-instantiate -A somepackage
 # assumes you are now using flakes
 new$ nix eval .#somepackage.drvPath
 # alternative option
 new$ nix derivation show .#somepackage | jq '.[keys[0]]' | nix derivation add
