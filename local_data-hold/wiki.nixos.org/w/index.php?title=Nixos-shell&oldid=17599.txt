   nixos-shell is a small helper script for spawning lightweight NixOS
   virtual machines in a shell.

Installation

   Add following line to your system configuration to install the program

 environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.nixos-shell ];

Usage

  Simple port forward

   Create a single example file containing the system configuration for the
   virtual machine

    

 myvm.nix

 { pkgs, ... }: {
   services.dokuwiki.sites."localhost" = {
     enable = true;
     settings.title = "My Wiki";
   };
 }

   In this example, we'll have a virtual guest machine running an instance of
   DokuWiki on port 80. Start the VM while forwarding port 8080 on the host
   to port 80 on the guest

 QEMU_NET_OPTS="hostfwd=tcp::8080-:80" nixos-shell myvm.nix

   After the VM is successfully booted, DokuWiki will be available on
   http://localhost:8080

  Mounting host directories

   This snippet mounts the directory calendar which resides in the working
   directory where you run nixos-shell on the host. It gets mounted to
   /var/lib/nextcloud/store-apps/calendar on the guest. The target directory
   must exist before mounting gets executed.

    

 myvm.nix

 { pkgs, ... }: {
   nixos-shell.mounts.extraMounts = {
     "/var/lib/nextcloud/store-apps/calendar" = {
        target = ./calendar;
        cache = "none";
     };
   };
 };

   Mounting is done through the network filesystem protocol 9p. Currently
   it's not possible to mount the target directory with a specific UID/GID,
   so you'll have to change the permissions on the host directory according
   to your needs.

  Inside Nix Flake

   Using following Flakes example, you can start a virtual machine using
   nixos-shell by just typing nix run

    

 flake.nix

 {
   description = "Spawns lightweight nixos vm in a shell";

   inputs = {
     nixpkgs.url = "nixpkgs/nixos-23.11";
     nixos-shell.url = "github:Mic92/nixos-shell";
   };

   outputs = { self, nixpkgs, nixos-shell }: let
     pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.x86_64-linux;
     start =
       pkgs.writeShellScriptBin "start" ''
         set -e
         export QEMU_NET_OPTS="hostfwd=tcp::8080-:80"
         ${pkgs.nixos-shell}/bin/nixos-shell --flake .
       '';
   in {

     nixosConfigurations.vm = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
       system = "x86_64-linux";
       modules = [
         (import ./myvm.nix)
         nixos-shell.nixosModules.nixos-shell
       ];
     };

     packages = { inherit start; };
     defaultPackage.x86_64-linux = start;

   };
 }

   The configuration of the virtual machine is inside the file myvm.nix in
   the same directory. The virtual machine will use the nixpkgs source
   defined in the flake inputs.
