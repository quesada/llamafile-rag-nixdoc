   From NixOS Wiki

   Nixpkgs is the largest repository of Nix packages and NixOS modules. The
   repository is hosted on GitHub and maintained by the community, with
   official backing from the NixOS Foundation.

   To search among available packages and options, see Searching packages.

   As highlighted in the announcement of the NixOS 21.05 release, "NixOS is
   already known as the most up to date distribution and is in the top three
   by total number of packages." This is thanks to the community's continued
   dedication to making Nixpkgs the preeminent Linux package repository.

Releases

   Main article: Channel branches

   The packages and modules hosted on Nixpkgs are distributed through various
   channel branches intended for particular use-cases. In practice they are
   differentiated by the level of testing updates must pass on the official
   nixos.org Hydra instance and the number of updates they receive.

   For NixOS users, nixos-unstable channel branch is the rolling release,
   where packages pass build tests and integration tests on a VM, and are
   tested from the perspective of being an operative system (this means
   things like the X server, KDE, various servers, and lower level details
   like installing bootloaders and runnning the NixOS installation steps are
   also tested).

   For standalone Nix users, nixpkgs-unstable channel branch is the rolling
   release, where packages pass only basic build tests and are upgraded
   continuously.

   Both NixOS and Nix users can use stable channel branches - the latest
   being nixos-23.11 - to receive only conservative updates for fixing
   critical bugs and security vulnerabilities. Stable channel branches are
   released bi-annually at the end of May and the end of November.

   Using stable channels on NixOS is comparable to the user experience on
   other Linux distributions.

Alternatives

   Due to the fact that Nixpkgs is only a Nix expression, it is possible to
   extend or replace the logic with your own sources. In fact, there are a
   number of extensions as well as complete replacements for Nixpkgs, see the
   Alternative Package Sets article.
