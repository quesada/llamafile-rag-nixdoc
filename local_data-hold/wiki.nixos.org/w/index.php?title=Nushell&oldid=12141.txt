   Nushell is a powerfull shell written in Rust.

Installation

   See Command Shell example if you want Nushell as your default shell.

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 users.users.myuser= {
    ... 
         shell = pkgs.nushell;
 };

Configuration

   Nushell can be configured with Home Manager.

    Examples

   Configuration with Starship prompt and autosuggestion support with
   carapace

    

 ~/.config/nixpkgs/home.nix

 programs = {
     nushell = { enable = true;
       # The config.nu can be anywhere you want if you like to edit your Nushell with Nu
       configFile.source = ./.../config.nu;
       # for editing directly to config.nu
       extraConfig = ''
        let carapace_completer = {|spans|
            carapace $spans.0 nushell ...$spans | from json
        }
        $env.config = {
         show_banner: false,
         completions: {
         case_sensitive: false # case-sensitive completions
         quick: true    # set to false to prevent auto-selecting completions
         partial: true    # set to false to prevent partial filling of the prompt
         algorithm: "fuzzy"    # prefix or fuzzy
         external: {
         # set to false to prevent nushell looking into $env.PATH to find more suggestions
             enable: true
         # set to lower can improve completion performance at the cost of omitting some options
             max_results: 100
             completer: $carapace_completer # check 'carapace_completer'
           }
         }
        }
        $env.PATH = ($env.PATH |
        split row (char esep) |
        prepend /home/myuser/.apps |
        append /usr/bin/env
        )
        '';
        shellAliases = {
        vi = "hx";
        vim = "hx";
        nano = "hx";
        };
    }; 
    carapace.enable = true;
    carapace.enableNushellIntegration = true;

    starship = { enable = true;
        settings = {
          add_newline = true;
          character = {
          success_symbol = "[➜](bold green)";
          error_symbol = "[➜](bold red)";
        };
     };
   };
 };
