   ONLYOFFICE is a software suite that offers online and offline tools for
   document editing, collaboration, and management. It is developed by
   Ascensio System SIA, a company based in Riga, Latvia. ONLYOFFICE consists
   of several components, such as Docs, Workspace, Desktop Editors, and
   Mobile Apps. It is an open-source project that aims to provide a secure
   and compatible alternative to other office suites.

Installation

   Add following line to your configuration to enable ONLYOFFICE

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.onlyoffice-bin ];

Troubleshooting

  Install and use missing corefonts

   According to one upstream bug ONLYOFFICE is unable to locate font files on
   NixOS. A workaround is to install missing or additional fonts and copy
   them to the user directory

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 # Allow installation of unfree corefonts package
 nixpkgs.config.allowUnfreePredicate = pkg:
   builtins.elem (lib.getName pkg) [ "corefonts" ];

 fonts.fonts = with pkgs; [
   corefonts
 ];

 # mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fonts
 Query store path to the corefonts package
 # NIXPKGS_ALLOW_UNFREE=1 nix-store --query --outputs $(nix-instantiate '<nixpkgs>' -A corefonts)
 Change the store path according to result of the command above
 # cp /nix/store/ssw7d3cl2dzps6y1c88c01xclsigmjqf-corefonts-1/share/fonts/truetype/* ~/.local/share/fonts/
 # chmod 644 ~/.local/share/fonts/*
