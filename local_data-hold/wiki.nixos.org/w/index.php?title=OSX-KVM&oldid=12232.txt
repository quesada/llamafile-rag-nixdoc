   OSX-KVM allows to run macOS on Linux machines.

Installation

   Enable virtualisation support in your system configuration by adding
   following lines

 {
   virtualisation.libvirtd.enable = true;
   users.extraUsers.youruser.extraGroups = [ "libvirtd" ];

   boot.extraModprobeConfig = ''
     options kvm_intel nested=1
     options kvm_intel emulate_invalid_guest_state=0
     options kvm ignore_msrs=1
   '';
 }

   Replace youruser with the user name of your running system. After applying
   the configuration, reboot your system so the changes to the kernel modules
   can take effect.

Usage

   Note: This instruction uses a custom fork of OSX-KVM with Nix Flake
   support. Hopefully these changes will soon be merged to the upstream
   repository.

   Git clone the project repository and run nix run to prepare and run your
   MacOS system

 git clone -b flake https://github.com/onny/OSX-KVM.git
 cd OSX-KVM
 nix run

   You may also want to adjust the cpu count/memory in ./OpenCore-Boot.sh if
   your systems resources allow it.

   On the first run, from the boot menu, select disk utilities and erase /
   format the Qemu disk that will be used for installation. Then choose the
   installer from the boot menu. Select the previously created disk image as
   install target.

   On the next boot you will a new boot entry containing the actual
   installation.
