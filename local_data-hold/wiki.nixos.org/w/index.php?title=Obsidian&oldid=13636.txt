   Obsidian^[1] is the private and flexible writing app that adapts to the
   way you think.

Installation

   Obsidian can be installed from nixpkgs:

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
   obsidian
 ];

   On NixOs 23.11, you must add the following line in your
   configuration^[2]^[3] :

 nixpkgs.config.permittedInsecurePackages = [
   "electron-25.9.0"
 ];

   If you upgraded to 24.05, this line is no longer needed.
