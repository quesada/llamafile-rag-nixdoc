   From NixOS Wiki

    This article or section needs expansion.                                  
    Reason: This page is a work in progress. (Discuss in Talk:OfBorg#)        
    Please consult the pedia article metapage for guidelines on contributing. 

   OfBorg is the primary CI service on Nixpkgs.

Trivia

   The name "Of Borg" is in reference to an American TV series called Star
   Trek, where a prominent character was assimilated into an alien group and
   his name changed to "Locutus Of Borg". Further information can be found in
   the ofborg issues tracker.
