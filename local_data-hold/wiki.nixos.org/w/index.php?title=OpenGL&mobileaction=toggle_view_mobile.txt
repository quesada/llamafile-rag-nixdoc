   From NixOS Wiki

    This article or section is a candidate for merging with Mesa.             
    Notes: Most of the content here is related to the mesa package (Discuss   
    in Talk:OpenGL#)                                                          

   You can enable OpenGL by setting hardware.graphics.enable = true;^[note 1]
   in your /etc/nixos/configuration.nix.

   OpenGL must break purity due to the need for hardware-specific linkage.
   Intel, AMD, and Nvidia have different drivers for example. On NixOS, these
   libraries are symlinked under

  /run/opengl-driver/lib

   and optionally (if hardware.graphics.enable32Bit^[note 2] is enabled)

  /run/opengl-driver-32/lib

   When a program is installed in your environment, these libraries should be
   found automatically. However, this is not the case in a `nix-shell`. To
   fix, add this line to your shell.nix:

 LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/run/opengl-driver/lib:/run/opengl-driver-32/lib";

Testing Mesa updates

   To avoid a lot of rebuilds there's an internal NixOS option to override
   the Mesa drivers: hardware.opengl.package

   It can be used like this:

 hardware.opengl.package = (import /srv/nixpkgs-mesa { }).pkgs.mesa.drivers;

   However, since Mesa 21.0.2 this doesn't necessarily work anymore and
   something like the following might be required:

 system.replaceRuntimeDependencies = [
   ({ original = pkgs.mesa; replacement = (import /srv/nixpkgs-mesa { }).pkgs.mesa; })
   ({ original = pkgs.mesa.drivers; replacement = (import /srv/nixpkgs-mesa { }).pkgs.mesa.drivers; })
 ];

   Note: Both of these approaches are impure and only work to a certain
   degree (many limitations!). If you want to use a different version of Mesa
   your best option is to use an overlay or a Git worktree where you use the
   same Nixpkgs revision and only alter pkgs/development/libraries/mesa/ for
   one of the two approaches mentioned above.

Debugging Mesa issues

   There are a lot of useful environment variables for debugging purposes:
   https://docs.mesa3d.org/envvars.html

   The most important one is LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose and helps with debugging
   error like:

 libGL error: MESA-LOADER: failed to open $DRIVER (search paths /run/opengl-driver/lib/dri)
 libGL error: failed to load driver: $DRIVER

  glxinfo

   Use glxinfo to load 3D acceleration debug information.

   If glxinfo returns Error: couldn't find RGB GLX visual or fbconfig, ensure
   you have hardware.opengl.extraPackages = [ pkgs.mesa.drivers ]; set.

Notes

    1. ↑ Renamed from hardware.opengl.enable in NixOS 24.11
    2. ↑ Renamed from hardware.opengl.driSupport32Bit in NixOS 24.11
