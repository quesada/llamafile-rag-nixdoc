   OpenRGB is a powerful open-source software for controlling RGB lighting on
   various computer components and peripherals. It provides a unified
   interface for managing RGB devices from different manufacturers,
   eliminating the need for multiple proprietary software solutions. With
   OpenRGB, users can customize their PC's lighting effects, synchronize
   colors across devices, and create dynamic lighting profiles. This tool is
   particularly useful for users who want to maintain full control over their
   system's RGB lighting without relying on closed-source applications.

Installation

   ⚠
   Please do note that installing this package by itself will lead to udev
   rules not being set up correctly. It is recommended to have both
   services.hardware.openrgb.enable = true; and the package installed (either
   openrgb or openrgb-with-all-plugins)

    Using nix-shell

 nix-shell -p openrgb

    Using Global Configuration

 environment.systemPackages = [
   pkgs.openrgb
 ];

   After modifying your configuration, apply the changes by running:

 sudo nixos-rebuild switch

    Using Home Configuration

 home.packages = [
   pkgs.openrgb
 ];

   After updating your configuration, apply the changes by running:

 home-manager switch

Configuration

    Basic

 services.hardware.openrgb.enable = true;

    Advanced

 services.hardware.openrgb = {
   enable = true;
   package = pkgs.openrgb-with-all-plugins;
   motherboard = "amd";
   server = {
     port = 6742;
     autoStart = true;
   };
 };

Tips and Tricks

    Location of Options

   The global options are listed on MyNixOS.

    Turn off RGB

   If you'd like to turn off all RGB devices supported by OpenRGB, consider
   something like:

 { pkgs, lib, ... }:
 let
   no-rgb = pkgs.writeScriptBin "no-rgb" ''
     #!/bin/sh
     NUM_DEVICES=$(${pkgs.openrgb}/bin/openrgb --noautoconnect --list-devices | grep -E '^[0-9]+: ' | wc -l)

     for i in $(seq 0 $(($NUM_DEVICES - 1))); do
       ${pkgs.openrgb}/bin/openrgb --noautoconnect --device $i --mode static --color 000000
     done
   '';
 in {
   config = {
     services.udev.packages = [ pkgs.openrgb ];
     boot.kernelModules = [ "i2c-dev" ];
     hardware.i2c.enable = true;

     systemd.services.no-rgb = {
       description = "no-rgb";
       serviceConfig = {
         ExecStart = "${no-rgb}/bin/no-rgb";
         Type = "oneshot";
       };
       wantedBy = [ "multi-user.target" ];
     };
   };
 }
