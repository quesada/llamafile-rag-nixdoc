   Opensnitch is a configurable inbound and outbound firewall with support
   for configurable rules by application, port, host, etc.

Installation

   Add following line to your system configuration to install and enable
   OpenSnitch

 services.opensnitch.enable = true;

   OpenSnitch will start blocking connctions as soon the client application
   opensnitch-ui is connected. For Home Manager users, you can automatically
   start it in the background with the following configuration

 home-manager.users.myuser = {
   services.opensnitch-ui.enable = true;
 };

   Using this minimal and default configuration, an application which tries
   to connect to the outside network will be blocked. You'll see a popup
   window asking to grant or deny connectivity for the specific application.

Configuration

   You can preconfigure which connections are allowed or blocked by default.
   Following rules will allow internet connectivity for the binaries
   systemd-resolved and systemd-timesyncd. All other connection requests will
   be blocked and require an manual exception.

 services.opensnitch = {
   enable = true;
   rules = {
     systemd-timesyncd = {
       name = "systemd-timesyncd";
       enabled = true;
       action = "allow";
       duration = "always";
       operator = {
         type ="simple";
         sensitive = false;
         operand = "process.path";
         data = "${lib.getBin pkgs.systemd}/lib/systemd/systemd-timesyncd";
       };
     };
     systemd-resolved = {
       name = "systemd-resolved";
       enabled = true;
       action = "allow";
       duration = "always";
       operator = {
         type ="simple";
         sensitive = false;
         operand = "process.path";
         data = "${lib.getBin pkgs.systemd}/lib/systemd/systemd-resolved";
       };
     };
   };
 };

   Please refer upstream documentation for configuration syntax and
   additional examples.
