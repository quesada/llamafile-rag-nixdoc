   The Nix language is designed for conveniently creating and composing
   derivations – precise descriptions of how contents of existing files are
   used to derive new files.

   Note: Check the Nix Reference Manual on the Nix Language for up-to-date
   documentation and Nix language basics for a gentle introduction.

   The .nix files are written in the Nix language. While being a NixOS user
   doesn't demand complete mastery of Nix, customizing code snippets is
   necessary.
