   PCManFM is a free file manager application and the standard file manager
   of LXDE.

Installation

   Install the pcmanfm package.

  Additional features

   Add lxmenu-data to be offered a list of "Installed applications" when
   opening a file.

   Add shared-mime-info to recognise different file types.

    USB Automounting

   For USB mounting support, add the following line to your configuration:

     services.gvfs.enable = true;

   If automounting still does not work you may need to explicitly enable
   devmon and udisks2. Keep in mind that all removable media will
   automatically mounted even without pcmanfm running.

   configuration.nix

     services.udisks2.enable = true;
     services.devmon.enable = true;

    SAMBA mount support

   Configuration can be found under the Samba wiki page.
