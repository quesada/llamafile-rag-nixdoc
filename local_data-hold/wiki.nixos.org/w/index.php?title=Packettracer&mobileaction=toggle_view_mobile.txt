   From NixOS Wiki

   Packettracer is a network simulation software. The tool from Cisco is
   suitable, for example, for training as an IT specialist to learn how to
   deal with networks and, in particular, how to behave in the event of
   problems. A free and open source alternative would be GNS3

Installation

   You need to enable unfree and prefetch the .deb file from Packettracer
   before you are able to installing it. The Package is allready available
   for Nix. Other Unix/Linux Distros with Nix installed can installing it on
   their system aswell.

  # or with
  $nix-prefetch-url --type sha256 file:///path/to/CiscoPacketTracer_"version"_Ubuntu_64bit.deb
