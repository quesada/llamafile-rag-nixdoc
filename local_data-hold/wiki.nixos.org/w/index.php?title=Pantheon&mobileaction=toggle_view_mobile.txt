   From NixOS Wiki

   Pantheon is a simple yet beautiful desktop environment made for elementary
   OS. The Pantheon desktop environment is built on top of the GNOME software
   base, i.e. GTK, GDK, GLib, GVfs, etc. with Vala programming language.

   This article is an extension of the documentation in the NixOS manual.

Installing Pantheon Desktop Environment

   To use the Pantheon, add this to your configuration.nix:

 services.xserver.enable = true;
 services.xserver.desktopManager.pantheon.enable = true;

   This automatically enables LightDM and Pantheon's LightDM greeter. If
   you'd like to disable this, set

 services.xserver.displayManager.lightdm.greeters.pantheon.enable = false;
 services.xserver.displayManager.lightdm.enable = false;

   be aware using Pantheon without LightDM as a display manager will break
   screenlocking from the UI. The NixOS module for Pantheon installs all of
   Pantheon's default applications. If you'd like to not install Pantheon's
   apps, set

 services.pantheon.apps.enable = false;

   You can also use to remove any other app (like elementary-mail).

Wingpanel and Switchboard plugins

   Wingpanel and Switchboard work differently than they do in other
   distributions, as far as using plugins. You cannot install a plugin
   globally (like with option environment.systemPackages) to start using it.
   You should instead be using the following options:

     * opt-services.xserver.desktopManager.pantheon.extraWingpanelIndicators
     * opt-services.xserver.desktopManager.pantheon.extraSwitchboardPlugs

   to configure the programs with plugs or indicators.

   The difference in NixOS is both these programs are patched to load plugins
   from a directory that is the value of an environment variable. All of
   which is controlled in Nix. If you need to configure the particular
   packages manually you can override the packages like:

 wingpanel-with-indicators.override {
   indicators = [
     pkgs.some-special-indicator
   ];
 };

 switchboard-with-plugs.override {
   plugs = [
     pkgs.some-special-plug
   ];
 };

   please note that, like how the NixOS options describe these as extra
   plugins, this would only add to the default plugins included with the
   programs. If for some reason you'd like to configure which plugins to use
   exactly, both packages have an argument for this:

 wingpanel-with-indicators.override {
   useDefaultIndicators = false;
   indicators = specialListOfIndicators;
 };

 switchboard-with-plugs.override {
   useDefaultPlugs = false;
   plugs = specialListOfPlugs;
 };

   this could be most useful for testing a particular plug-in in isolation.

Frequently Asked Questions

  I have switched from a different desktop and Pantheon’s theming looks messed
  up.

   Open Switchboard (System Settings) and go to: Administration → System →
   Restore Default Settings → Restore Settings. This will reset any dconf
   settings to their Pantheon defaults. Note this could reset certain
   GNOME-specific preferences if that desktop was used prior.

  I cannot enable both GNOME and Pantheon.

   This is a known issue and there is no known workaround except for Nix
   Specialisation with either different user setups (one for GNOME and
   another for Pantheon) or Impermanence setup with no persistent home so
   that configs and themes do not conflict.

  Does AppCenter work, or is it available?

   AppCenter has been available since 20.03. Starting from 21.11, the Flatpak
   backend should work so you can install some Flatpak applications using it.
   However, due to missing appstream metadata, the Packagekit backend does
   not function currently. See this issue.

   If you are using Pantheon, AppCenter should be installed by default if you
   have Flatpak support enabled. If you also wish to add the appcenter
   Flatpak remote:

 flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists appcenter https://flatpak.elementary.io/repo.flatpakrepo
