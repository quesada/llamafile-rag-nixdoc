   Pidgin is a multi-protocol messaging client.

   Pidgin is available in NixOS, as are many popular plugins such as
   pidgin-otr.

Installing plugins

   NixOS provides Pidgin plugins as packages such as pidginotr, but
   installing them via nix-env or environment.systemPackages will not work.
   The plugin packages must be configured as part of the pidgin-with-plugins
   package via a package override.

  User-scope installation

   To install Pidgin with desired plugins only for the current user:

    1. In ~/.config/nixpkgs/config.nix, add:

 {
   ...
   packageOverrides = pkgs: rec {
     pidgin-with-plugins = pkgs.pidgin.override {
       ## Add whatever plugins are desired (see nixos.org package listing).
       plugins = [ pkgs.pidgin-otr ];
     };
   };
   ...
 }

    2. Install pidgin with nix-env -iA nixos.pidgin-with-plugins

  System-scope installation

   To install Pidgin with desired plugins for all users on the system:

    1. Amend /etc/nixos/configuration.nix to add pidgin-with-plugins to
       systemPackages:

 {
   ...
   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     pidgin-with-plugins
   ];
   ...
 }

    2. Override pidgin-with-plugins to add the desired plugins:

 {
   ...
   nixpkgs.config = {
     allowUnfree = true;
     packageOverrides = pkgs: with pkgs; {
       pidgin-with-plugins = pkgs.pidgin.override {
         ## Add whatever plugins are desired (see nixos.org package listing).
         plugins = [ pidgin-otr ];
       };
     };
   };
   ...
 }

    3. Run nixos-rebuild switch as root to apply changes.
