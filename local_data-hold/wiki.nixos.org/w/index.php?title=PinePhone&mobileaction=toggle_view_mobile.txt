   From NixOS Wiki

   PinePhone is supported by Mobile NixOS:
   https://mobile.nixos.org/devices/pine64-pinephone.html

   This guide is discusses how to use Phosh, the GNOME-derived UI used by
   Librem and Mobian.

Requirements

   This document assumes you have set up NixOS on your PinePhone, as
   described in https://mobile.nixos.org/getting-started.html

   Beware known issues:

     * boot.growPartition has no effect
     * how to cross-compile

Status

  Phosh

   Working with:

 xserver.desktopManager.phosh = {
   enable = true;
   user = "alice";
   group = "users";
   # for better compatibility with x11 applications
   phocConfig.xwayland = "immediate";
 };

  Battery

   Wake-on-modem works. Wake-on-WiFi is not supported. Something like
   https://gist.github.com/Peetz0r/bf8fd93a60962b4afcf2daeb4305da40 is
   needed.

  Browsing

     * GNOME Web is installed by default.
     * `pkgs.firefox-wayland` works but doesn't scale down the UI well.
       https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/mobile-config-firefox is needed for
       that.

  Sound

   Working. Settings -> Sound ->Output -> Configuration -> HiFi

  Calling

   Working with:

 programs.calls.enable = true;
 # Optional but recommended. https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/162894
 systemd.services.ModemManager.serviceConfig.ExecStart = [
   "" # clear ExecStart from upstream unit file.
   "${pkgs.modemmanager}/sbin/ModemManager --test-quick-suspend-resume"
 ];

   Known issues:

     * incoming calls don't trigger music to be paused. Likely need something
       like
       https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/librem5-base/-/merge_requests/170/diffs

  SMS

   Working with:

 environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.chatty ];

  MMS

   Unsupported. See https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/chatty/-/issues/30

  Camera

   pkgs.megapixels is the only known application to work with Pinephone. Does
   not always start correctly, retrying might help.

     * Front camera works out-of-the-box.
     * Back camera works, but autofocus does not (
       https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/issues/393 )

  Mobile internet

   Working via gnome-control-center ("Mobile Broadband" section), or:

 $ nmcli c add type gsm ifname cdc-wdm0 con-name $PROVIDER apn $APN

  GPS

   Working with GNOME applications with:

     * [IMG] allow Phosh to use geoclue
     * and the following:

 services.geoclue2.enable = true;
 users.users.geoclue.extraGroups = [ "networkmanager" ];

  Sensors

   The acceleration, compass, and ambient light sensors provide working
   auto-rotation, compass, and auto-brightness, when you:

 hardware.sensor.iio.enable = true;
 hardware.firmware = [ config.mobile.device.firmware ];

  Disk encryption

   The boot process supports opening LUKS volumes. Creating an image to use
   LUKS is unsupported, but possible. The idea is to write an encrypted LUKS
   volume to the root partition, as described in
   https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/tree/master/examples/testing/qemu-cryptsetup.

  Hardware acceleration for video

   See https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/issues/398.

  Torch

   Working, per https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/issues/379

  Bluetooth

   Working with:

 mobile.boot.stage-1.firmware = [
   config.mobile.device.firmware
 ];

  Modem firmware

   Per
   https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PineModems#Upgrade/switch_firmware_via_fwupd
   , fwupd can be used to flash the FOSS Modem firmware. To enable fwupd:

 services.fwupd.enable = true;

  Alarm clocks

   Not working:

     * GNOME Clocks will not wake up the phone:
       https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-clocks/-/issues/100
     * https://github.com/Dejvino/birdie looks good, but is not packaged.

Recommended applications

   See https://linmobapps.frama.io/ for a list of applications that behave
   well on small screens, and in particular https://apps.gnome.org/.
