     * curprev [ ] [ ] 19:5419:54, 2 October 2024‎ Birbirl talk contribs‎
       13,676 bytes +531‎ My first edit on this wiki! I struggled quite a bit
       with configuring wireplumber to fix an issue that i've seen a ton of
       people deal with, about wireplumber switching modes when you'd least
       want it to, causing all sorts of interference. Disabling that function
       on Nix is an easy one liner, but takes a lot of effort to get there
       through heaps of documentation. So i decided to add the code snippet.
       Also fixed an error and mentioned that .lua files have been scrapped
       in wireplumber 5.0. :D Tag: Visual edit
