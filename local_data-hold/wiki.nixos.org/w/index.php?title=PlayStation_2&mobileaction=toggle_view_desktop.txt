   From NixOS Wiki

   With 155 million sold, the PS2 was the best-selling gaming console ever.
   Home-brew development is still going on, and many games recover online
   gaming capability since developer are rewriting game server. A list of
   PlayStation 2 Online Games is available here.

                                   Emulation

   This section explains how to run Playstation 2 games on NixOS.

PCSX2

   You need a legal copy of your ps2 bios. There are many ways to do it, i
   just describe an easy but slowly one using uLaunchELF :

 1/ get latest ps2ident from https://github.com/ps2homebrew/PS2Ident/releases/tag/stable
 2/ extract somewhere on an USB mass storage
 3/ launch it from uLaunchELF (mass:) , then select USB as save device
 4/ waiiiiiiiiiiiit. ( slow USB 1, notice progress bars )
 5/ copy files in the right pcsx2 directory ( by default /home/<username>/.config/PCSX2/bios )

   You can also explore the bios file using romdirfs.

                                  Development

   If you want to develop for the PlayStation 2 on NixOS you'll probably want
   to use the Open Source PS2SDK . The section below explains how to
   bootstrap the toolchain in order to have a working development
   environment.

Building the open source PS2SDK on NixOS

   You can use the following nix-shell script to build the open source PS2SDK
   through ps2dev.

 { pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:
 let fhs = pkgs.buildFHSUserEnv {
   name = "ps2dev";
   targetPkgs = pkgs: (with pkgs; [
     autoconf
     automake
     libtool
     gnumake
     clang
     clang-tools
     gcc
     wget
     git
     patch
     texinfo
     bash
     file
     bison
     flex
     gettext
     gsl
     gnum4
     gmp.dev
     gmp.out
     mpfr.out
     mpfr.dev
     libmpc
     cmake
     zlib.dev
     zlib.out
   ]);
   runScript = "bash";
 };
 in pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
   name = "ps2dev-shell";
   nativeBuildInputs = [ fhs ];
   hardeningDisable = [ "format" ];
   shellHook = ''
     # or whatever you want
     export PS2DEV=$HOME/ps2
     mkdir -p $PS2DEV
     chown -R $USER: $PS2DEV

     # setup login env
     export PS2SDK=$PS2DEV/ps2sdk
     export PATH=$PATH:$PS2DEV/bin:$PS2DEV/ee/bin:$PS2DEV/iop/bin:$PS2DEV/dvp/bin:$PS2SDK/bin
     export CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PS2DEV
     exec ps2dev
     '';
 }

   You will have to run this shell each time you want to enter in an
   environment with the SDK tools available or, alternatively, re-export
   those environment variables in the shell of your liking:

 # or whatever you want
 export PS2DEV=$HOME/ps2
 export PS2SDK=$PS2DEV/ps2sdk
 export PATH=$PATH:$PS2DEV/bin:$PS2DEV/ee/bin:$PS2DEV/iop/bin:$PS2DEV/dvp/bin:$PS2SDK/bin

                          PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay

   Read more about it :
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2_Expansion_Bay Only genuine
   Sony adapter offers network capability, you can upgrade them to sata
   thanks to a SATA mod kit from bitfunx or maxdiypower. On slim model, you
   can find kit too, but you will need to solder on the motherboard.

HDD Partitioning

   Playstation 2 use PFS filesystem and APA partitions see libHdd Reference
   Manual for more information. You could use pfsshell on PC to create APA
   partition and format to PFS. pfsshell's author advises you to not use it
   as root.

 # chown myuser /dev/sdb

 $ pfsshell
 pfsshell for POSIX systems
 https://github.com/uyjulian/pfsshell

 This program uses pfs, apa, iomanX,
 code from ps2sdk (https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2sdk)

 Type "help" for a list of commands.

  install wLauncher

   In order to be able to launch unofficial softwares, you can :

     * launch a dvd with FreeDVDBoot
     * have a modchip
     * boot with a FMCB installed memory card
     * boot on HDD with an elf launcher like wLauncher or SoftDev2

   Extract this archive (wLE_kHn_20200810.7z
   md5:430af5615895736d96b4f7156e92b2b0 dl source) then call hdl_dump:

 $ hdl_dump initialize /dev/sdb MBR.KELF

  install FHDB (Free HDBoot)

   Get FMCB installer from official
   website :https://sites.google.com/view/ysai187/home/projects/fmcbfhdb

   You should be able to launch it following the instruction there.

  Install games

   Games doesn't use PFS but HDLoader partition so we can't rely on pfsshell
   to install them. Use hdl_dump (see hdl_dump help) :

  $ hdl_dump install /dev/sdb Final\ Fantasy\ X\ \(France\).iso

Network

  Samba

   works fine - example soon.

  FTP transfer

   A very slow solution ( ~ 500KB/s ).

     * PC side (client) :

   PS2 doesn't support TLS, use plain FTP. (tested with filezilla)

     * PS2 side (server) :

   Launch ps2net. You need to activate hdd (exploring it in uLaunchELF for
   example) before ps2net to share it.
