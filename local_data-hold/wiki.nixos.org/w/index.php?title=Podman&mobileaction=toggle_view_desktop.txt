   Podman can run rootless containers and be a drop-in replacement for
   Docker.

Setup

   To enable Podman support, add following lines to your system configuration

 # Enable common container config files in /etc/containers
 virtualisation.containers.enable = true;
 virtualisation = {
   podman = {
     enable = true;
     # Create a `docker` alias for podman, to use it as a drop-in replacement
     dockerCompat = true;
     # Required for containers under podman-compose to be able to talk to each other.
     defaultNetwork.settings.dns_enabled = true;
   };
 };

 users.users.myuser = {
   isNormalUser = true;
   extraGroups = [ "podman" ];
 };

   Replace myuser with your current user. A reboot or re-login might be
   required for the permissions to take effect after applying changes.

Tips and tricks

  podman-compose

   podman-compose is a drop-in replacement for docker-compose

  Using podman with ZFS

   Rootless can't use ZFS directly but the overlay needs POSIX ACL enabled
   for the underlying ZFS filesystem, ie., acltype=posixacl

   Best to mount a dataset under /var/lib/containers/storage with property
   acltype=posixacl.

  Use Podman within nix-shell

   https://gist.github.com/adisbladis/187204cb772800489ee3dac4acdd9947

   Note that rootless podman requires newuidmap (from shadow). If you're not
   on NixOS, this cannot be supplied by the Nix package 'shadow' since
   setuid/setgid programs are not currently supported by Nix.

  Run Podman containers as systemd services

 {
   virtualisation.oci-containers.backend = "podman";
   virtualisation.oci-containers.containers = {
     container-name = {
       image = "container-image";
       autoStart = true;
       ports = [ "127.0.0.1:1234:1234" ];
     };
   };
 }
