   This article covers configurations related to power management in terms of
   energy saving modes of various devices and components.

Configuration

  Hard drives

   Following snippet configures Udev rules which automatically run the
   program hdparm to enable power saving modes for hard disks, especially
   rotational drives mapped to /dev/sd*.

 services.udev.extraRules =
   let
     mkRule = as: lib.concatStringsSep ", " as;
     mkRules = rs: lib.concatStringsSep "\n" rs;
   in mkRules ([( mkRule [
     ''ACTION=="add|change"''
     ''SUBSYSTEM=="block"''
     ''KERNEL=="sd[a-z]"''
     ''ATTR{queue/rotational}=="1"''
     ''RUN+="${pkgs.hdparm}/bin/hdparm -B 90 -S 41 /dev/%k"''
   ])]);

   The hdparm parameters -B and -S define power saving modes and in case of
   -S the standby (spindown) timeout. The number 41 means therefore: Turn off
   the motor after 205 = 41*5 seconds.

  Suspend hooks

   NixOS provides the powerManagement.resumeCommands option which defines
   commands that are added to a global script that will be executed after
   resuming.

 powerManagement.resumeCommands = ''
   echo "This should show up in the journal after resuming."
 '';

   It is also possible to use the post-resume target directly to make a
   service.

   systemd.services.your-service-name = {
     description = "Service description here";
     wantedBy = [ "post-resume.target" ];
     after = [ "post-resume.target" ];
     script = ''
     echo "This should show up in the journal after resuming."
     '';
     serviceConfig.Type = "oneshot";
   };

  Hibernation

   Hibernation requires a configured swap device. See installation
   instructions on how to create a swap partition. An example configuration
   could look like this:

 swapDevices = [
   {
     device = "/dev/hda7";
   }
 ];
 boot.resumeDevice = "/dev/hda7";

   Please note that encrypted swap devices or swap files are not yet
   supported for hibernation. Test and use hibernation with following
   command:

 systemctl hibernate

Tips and tricks

  Go into hibernate after specific suspend time

   Using following configuration, your system will go from suspend into
   hibernate after 1 hour:

 systemd.sleep.extraConfig = ''
   HibernateDelaySec=1h
 '';

Troubleshooting

    System immediately wakes up from suspend

   Particularly in some Gigabyte motherboards with NVMe drives, the system
   may immediately wake up from being suspended. This can be worked around by
   disabling the wakeup triggers for the offending components:

      Solution 1: Disabling wakeup triggers for all PCIe devices

   If you don't need your system to wakeup via PCIe components you can simply
   disable it for all without needing to determine which component is causing
   problems.

 services.udev.extraRules = ''
   ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="pci", DRIVER=="pcieport", ATTR{power/wakeup}="disabled"
 '';

      Solution 2: Disable a common NVMe interface

   Specifically on Gigabyte motherboards you can try targetting only the NVMe
   ports.

 services.udev.extraRules = ''
   ACTION=="add" SUBSYSTEM=="pci" ATTR{vendor}=="0x1022" ATTR{device}=="0x1483" ATTR{power/wakeup}="disabled"
 '';

      Solution 3: Disable a single device's wakeup triggers

   If you wish to be more granular in what components should no longer be
   able to wakeup your system, you can find out which component is causing
   the wakeup events.

   First, list all components and their current wakeup status:

 $ cat /proc/acpi/wakeup
 Device  S-state   Status   Sysfs node
 GP12      S4    *enabled   pci:0000:00:07.1
 GP13      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:08.1
 XHC0      S4    *enabled   pci:0000:0a:00.3
 GP30      S4    *disabled
 ....
 PT27      S4    *disabled
 PT28      S4    *disabled
 PT29      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:03:09.0

   You can temporarily toggle a device by writing its "Device" name back into
   /proc/acpi/wakeup

 echo GPP0 | sudo tee /proc/acpi/wakeup

   After finding out which component is causing unwanted wakeups you can use
   the sysfs id to find out the "vendor" and "device" fields:

 $ cat /sys/class/pci_bus/0000:04/device/0000:04:00.0/vendor
 0x1987
 $ cat /sys/class/pci_bus/0000:04/device/0000:04:00.0/device
 0x5013

   And finally use those values in a udev rule:

 services.udev.extraRules = ''
   ACTION=="add" SUBSYSTEM=="pci" ATTR{vendor}=="0x1987" ATTR{device}=="0x5013" ATTR{power/wakeup}="disabled"
 '';
