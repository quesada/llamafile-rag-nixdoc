                   Building Proxmox Linux Containers with Nix

   You can use 'make-system-tarball' to create a Linux Container that can run
   on Proxmox, for example like
   https://codeberg.org/raboof/nix-mastodon-bot/src/branch/main/default.nix#L31

                                     NixOS

   With a small amount of work, it is possible to use NixOS as a LXC
   container under Proxmox.

Generate a container tarball

   A better way to deploy a NixOS container tarball on Proxmox is described
   at Proxmox Virtual Environment#LXC.

Finding a container tarball

   Go to https://hydra.nixos.org/project/nixos, choose a release (small ones
   don't have the tarball we need), and open its Jobs tab. On that page,
   search for nixos.containerTarball, open the link corresponding to your
   architecture (probably x86_64). Choose the latest success and click on the
   number. That is the ID of the result. Under Build products, download the
   system-tarball, which will be named nixos-system-x86_64-linux.tar.xz.

   Note the Build ID, it will be used when renaming the tarball... right when
   it's downloaded:

 mv nixos-system-x86_64-linux.tar.xz nixos-${RELEASE}-default_${BUILDID}_amd64.tar.xz

   This is a proxmox convention, and is useful to follow.

Preparing the container

   But first, you will need to upload the container tarball to the storage.

   Then, once this is done, you will need to access the CLI for the proxmox
   host. SSH or the web CLI will be fine.

  CLI operations

   In the CLI, create a container using the following command. If created as
   a template, I recommend setting a memorable ID.

 pct create 99999 \
   --description nixos-template \
   local:vztmpl/nixos-${RELEASE}-default_${BUILDID}_amd64.tar.xz \
   -ostype unmanaged \
   -net0 name=eth0 \
   -storage local-lvm

     Tip                                                   
     use tab-completion in the CLI for the local:... path! 

   Note that in the previous command, the -ostype option is necessary; this
   way Proxmox will not try to do fancy stuff to the system.

   The last step using the CLI, edit /etc/pve/lxc/99999.conf to add this
   line:

 lxc.init.cmd: /sbin/init

   Before NixOS version 21.11 it was

 lxc.init.cmd: /init

   .

  Creating a template

   It is not be possible to use the facilities to create a NixOS container
   under Proxmox. It is possible, though, to create a template that may be
   cloned as a base. In the GUI, with the container selected, click the More
   menu at the top, then Convert to template. Accept.

   To create a new NixOS container, you can then clone the template instead
   of doing the preceding steps.

Expected issues

  Entering the container by pct enter

   enter a (nixos) container from the proxmox host

 [root@proxmox:~]# pct enter <vmid>

 sh-5.2#

           set (missing) environment variables

 sh-5.2# source /etc/set-environment

 sh-5.2#

   or

           set (missing) environment variables with .

 sh-5.2# . /etc/profile

 [root@nixos:~]#

   If commands (like ls) still can't be found, try running:

 [root@nixos:~] /run/current-system/activate

  nixos-rebuild switch

   nixos-rebuild switch may fail with errors for special mount points. This
   does not look like it affects the container.

 [root@nixos:/]# nixos-rebuild switch

  Black Console in Proxmox

   The Proxmox console may appear black when launched. It is at the login
   prompt but no existing text is rendered. Just type "root" and hit enter
   and new text will get rendered just fine. If you are still unable to get
   the console to render, you can try changing the console to `/dev/console`
   instead of the standard tty.
