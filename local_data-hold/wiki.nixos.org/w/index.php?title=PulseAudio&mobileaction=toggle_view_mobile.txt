   From NixOS Wiki

   PulseAudio is a popular sound server for Linux. It is now required by a
   number of applications, and should be enabled if audio support is desired
   on NixOS. Enabling PulseAudio is sufficient to enable audio support on
   NixOS in most cases.

Enabling PulseAudio

   Add to your configuration:

 hardware.pulseaudio.enable = true;
 hardware.pulseaudio.support32Bit = true;    ## If compatibility with 32-bit applications is desired.

   You may need to add users to the audio group for them to be able to use
   audio devices:

 users.extraUsers.alice.extraGroups = [ "audio" ... ];

Explicit PulseAudio support in applications

   Normally, the system-wide ALSA configuration (/etc/asound.conf) redirects
   the audio of applications which use the ALSA API through PulseAudio. For
   this reason, most applications do not need to be PulseAudio-aware. Some
   NixOS packages can be built with explicit PulseAudio support which is
   disabled by default. This support can be enabled in all applicable
   packages by setting:

 nixpkgs.config.pulseaudio = true;

Enabling modules

   Modules can be loaded manually:

 pactl load-module module-combine-sink

   Or automatically:

 hardware.pulseaudio.extraConfig = "load-module module-combine-sink";

Disabling unwanted modules

 hardware.pulseaudio.extraConfig = "unload-module module-suspend-on-idle";

Using Pulseaudio Equalizer

   Currently (2017-11-29 [IMG] #8384) the qpaeq command does not work out of
   the box, use the following commands to get it running:

 $ pactl load-module module-equalizer-sink
 $ pactl load-module module-dbus-protocol
 $ nix-shell -p python27Full python27Packages.pyqt4 python27Packages.dbus-python --command qpaeq

Using Bauer stereophonic-to-binaural DSP library

   This module re-creates on a headset what you would hear in real-life,
   improving sound quality and decreasing brain fatigue.

   See the description of the project for more details:
   https://bs2b.sourceforge.net/

   The nix package to use is: libbs2b

   FIXME: getting an error while running:

 $ pactl load-module module-ladspa-sink sink_name=binaural master=bluez_sink.AA_BB_CC_DD_EE_FF.a2dp_sink plugin=bs2b label=bs2b control=700,4.5

Troubleshooting

  General troubleshooting

   Before troubleshooting PulseAudio, determine that the kernel-level sound
   APIs (ALSA) are functional; see ALSA.

   If ALSA-level audio is working, determine whether audio is being routed
   via PulseAudio.

   To determine what processes are using the sound devices:

 $ sudo lsof /dev/snd/*
 COMMAND     PID     USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
 pulseaudi 14080 goibhniu   30u   CHR  116,7      0t0 5169 /dev/snd/controlC0
 pulseaudi 14080 goibhniu   37u   CHR  116,7      0t0 5169 /dev/snd/controlC0

   In this example, only pulseaudio processes are using sound devices.

   If other processes (such as plugin-container) are using sound devices,
   this indicates they are bypassing PulseAudio; check that you don't have a
   local ~/.asoundrc file directing audio to somewhere else.

   Note that you may need to enable the full pulseaudio package using:

 hardware.pulseaudio.package = pkgs.pulseaudioFull;

 For example I had to enable this package in order to solve an error:

 snd_pcm_open failed: Device or resource busy

   (The problem is that also also tries to connect to the card that is
   already used by pulseaudio, so we need a module pulseaudio-alsa on
   pulseaudio to redirect also calls to pulseaudio)

  Clicking and Garbled Audio

   The newer implementation of the PulseAudio sound server uses timer-based
   audio scheduling instead of the traditional, interrupt-driven approach.

   Timer-based scheduling may expose issues in some ALSA drivers. On the
   other hand, other drivers might be glitchy without it on, so check to see
   what works on your system.

   To turn timer-based scheduling off add this to your configuration:

 hardware.pulseaudio.configFile = pkgs.runCommand "default.pa" {} ''
   sed 's/module-udev-detect$/module-udev-detect tsched=0/' \
     ${pkgs.pulseaudio}/etc/pulse/default.pa > $out
 '';

   Then perform # nixos-rebuild switch, followed by $ pulseaudio -k.

   The difference should be directly noticeable. This is a known issue
   related to quality of Creative driver [1], but it can also happen with
   other sound cards.

  Paprefs doesn't work on KDE

   If you run KDE (Plasma) and paprefs util doesn't work complaining about
   dconf, make sure you have programs.dconf.enable = true; in your NixOS
   configuration. Source.
