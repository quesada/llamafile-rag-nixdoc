QMK

   QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) is an open-source firmware for
   mechanical keyboards that enables users to customize and program various
   aspects of their keyboards. It provides a rich set of features for
   customization, including keymaps, macros, LED backlighting, and layers.

   QMK is built on top of the popular AVR and ARM microcontrollers, making it
   compatible with a wide range of keyboards, including custom and commercial
   keyboards. It allows users to create fully programmable keyboard layouts,
   which can then be saved, shared, and reused across different boards or
   devices.

NixOS configuration

   To access the keyboard for configuration as a normal non-root user add the
   following nixos configuration:

 {
   hardware.keyboard.qmk.enable = true
 }

   After that you can configure keyboard settings using the Via app (if your
   firmware has enabled support for it).

VIA

   VIA is a feature in QMK that lets you change your keymap on your keyboard
   without needing to reflash firmware. Your keyboard must support VIA in
   order for it to work.

  Installation

   Install the VIA package, and add the package to udev. The nixpkg disables
   the prompt to add the udev due to compatibility issues with NixOS, so it's
   necessary for the app to detect your keyboard.

 {
   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
      via
   ];
   services.udev.packages = [ pkgs.via ];
 }

   After updating udev rules a system restart is required for the changes to
   take effect.

Flashing custom firmware

   The qmk commandline application is fully supported in nixpkgs. After doing
   nix-shell -p qmk you can follow the upstream documentation for building,
   customizing and flashing your keyboard
