   Qtile is a full-featured, hackable tiling window manager written and
   configured in Python.

Enabling

   To enable Qtile as your window manager, set
   services.xserver.windowManager.qtile.enable = true. For example:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 {
   services.xserver.windowManager.qtile.enable = true;
 }

   To start Qtile on Wayland from your display manager (sddm, lightdm, etc)
   you have to add a Desktop Entry to your config like this.

    

 /etc/nixos/qtile.nix

 { config, pkgs, lib, ... }:

 {
   nixpkgs.overlays = [
   (self: super: {
     qtile-unwrapped = super.qtile-unwrapped.overrideAttrs(_: rec {
       postInstall = let
         qtileSession = ''
         [Desktop Entry]
         Name=Qtile Wayland
         Comment=Qtile on Wayland
         Exec=qtile start -b wayland
         Type=Application
         '';
         in
         ''
       mkdir -p $out/share/wayland-sessions
       echo "${qtileSession}" > $out/share/wayland-sessions/qtile.desktop
       '';
       passthru.providedSessions = [ "qtile" ];
     });
   })
 ];

 services.xserver.displayManager.sessionPackages = [ pkgs.qtile-unwrapped ];
 }

Warning

   The installation of Qtile leads to several of its dependencies being
   leaked in the user's PATH. This prevents the user from running a custom
   installation of python3 as Qtile will shadow the systemPackages in the
   PATH with its own python3. For more information see: Cannot use Globally
   Defined Python Environment While Inside Qtile and Kitty leaks packages
   into system environment (Additional context)
