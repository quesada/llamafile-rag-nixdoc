   QuakeJS is a browser-based port of Quake III Arena, enabling players to
   enjoy the classic shooter directly in their web browsers. It uses
   WebAssembly and WebGL to deliver the original gameplay experience without
   additional software.

Run the game

   The game can be run by opening it in a web browser and accepting
   persistent storage of the game files.

Setup of a dedicated server

   Following example configuration will enable QuakeJS for the
   domainhttp://quakejs.example.org:

   Note: Parts of this module are not yet stable will be available with the
   upcoming NixOS release 24.11.

 services.quakejs = {
   enable = true;
   hostname = "quakejs.example.org";
   eula = true;
   openFirewall = true;
   dedicated-server.enable = true;
 };

   Join your own dedicated server using the url:
   http://quakejs.example.org/play?connect%20192.0.2.0:27960, where 192.0.2.0
   is the public IP of your dedicated server.
