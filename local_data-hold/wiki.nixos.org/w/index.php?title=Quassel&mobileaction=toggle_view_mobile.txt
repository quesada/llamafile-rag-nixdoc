   From NixOS Wiki

   From the homepage:

   Quassel IRC is a modern, cross-platform, distributed IRC client, meaning
   that one (or multiple) client(s) can attach to and detach from a central
   core -- much like the popular combination of screen and a text-based IRC
   client such as WeeChat, but graphical. In addition to this unique feature,
   we aim to bring a pleasurable, comfortable chatting experience to all
   major platforms (including Linux®, Windows®, and MacOS X® as well as
   Android smartphones), making communication with your peers not only
   convenient, but also ubiquitous available.

Client

   Previously, multiple builds of Quassel clients were provided in Nixpkgs.
   It is not the case anymore.

   The client is quasselClient.

Server

   To enable the Quassel server (variously referred to as the Quassel daemon
   or Quassel Core), add

 services.quassel.enable = true;

   to your NixOS configuration. By default, the server only accepts
   connections from the local machine; set

 services.quassel.interfaces = [ "0.0.0.0" ];
 networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts = [ 4242 ];

   to accept external connections.

     Tip                                                                      
     In order to affect your system by your nix-language-specific changes you 
     have to evaluate it, run (as root):                                      
                                                                              
     # nixos-rebuild switch                                                   

   The first time you connect to the new server, a wizard will guide you
   through the remaining configuration steps. Before connecting to the new
   server, you may wish to optionally configure SSL or PostgreSQL.

SSL

   The Quassel server can use SSL if a certificate is provided. Install
   openssl (using nix-env or by adding it to environment.systemPackages) and
   run

 sudo -u quassel mkdir -p /home/quassel/.config/quassel-irc.org
 sudo -u quassel openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout /home/quassel/.config/quassel-irc.org/quasselCert.pem -out /home/quassel/.config/quassel-irc.org/quasselCert.pem

   You will be prompted for some details about the certificate. If
   quassel.service was running, restart it by running:

 sudo systemctl restart quassel.service

PostgreSQL

   By default, Quassel uses an SQLite database, but it can be configured to
   use PostgreSQL for better performance. (If you aren't sure which database
   backend you want to use, stay with SQLite because it is always possible to
   switch to PostgreSQL later.)

   Start by enabling the PostgreSQL service in your NixOS configuration:

  /* Enable the PostgreSQL service */
  services.postgresql = {
    enable = true;
    package = pkgs.postgresql94;
  };
 
  /* Only start Quassel after PostgreSQL has started */
  systemd.services.quassel.after = [ "postgresql.service" ];
 
  /* Make the quasselcore command available in the shell */
  environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.quasselDaemon_qt5 ];

   Activate this configuration with nixos-rebuild switch. Create a PostgreSQL
   role (user) for Quassel:

 sudo createuser -A -D -P -E -W quassel

   You will be prompted for a password; you will also need to provide the
   password to Quassel, so don't forget it! Create a PostgreSQL database for
   Quassel:

 sudo createdb -O quassel -E UTF8 quassel

   If you have never connected to this Quassel server before, you can connect
   now and select the PostgreSQL backend when prompted. You will need to
   provide the PostgreSQL username (quassel) and password you created above.

   If you are switching from the SQLite backend to the PostgreSQL backend,
   you will need to migrate the existing data. Stop the Quassel server with

 sudo systemctl stop quassel.service

   Start the migration with

 sudo -u quassel quasselcore --configdir=/home/quassel/.config/quassel-irc.org --select-backend=PostgreSQL

   You will need to provide the PostgreSQL username (quassel) and password
   you created above. When this is finished, restart the Quassel server:

 sudo systemctl start quassel.service
