  Upstream (NixOS) supported devices

   NixOS has no official support for riscv64-linux architecture on the
   nixpkgs-unstable and stable channel.

    Special Devices

   It is possible to emulate a RISC-V platform with QEMU. Programs may
   occasionally crash on QEMU with a segmentation fault despite working on
   native RISC-V hardware.^[1]^[2]

Installation

  Getting the installer

    SD card images (SBCs and similar platforms)

   For riscv64 it is possible to download images from the community.

     * Hifive Unmatched
     * VisionFive 1
     * VisionFive 2
     * STAR64
     * Lichee Pi 4A

   Build or download the image.

   If the image has the extension .zst, it will need to be decompressed
   before writing to installation device. Use nix-shell -p zstd --run "unzstd
   <img-name>.img.zst" to decompress the image.

NixOS Support

   All RISC-V platforms are experimental for the time being.

   There is a dedicated room for the upstream effort on Matrix,
   matrix:r/riscv:nixos.org.

  Awaiting upstream RISC-V support

     * LuaJIT
     * OpenJDK
     * GHC
     * Valgrind
