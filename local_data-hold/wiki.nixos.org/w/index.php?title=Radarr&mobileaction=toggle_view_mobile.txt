   From NixOS Wiki

   Radarr is a movie collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It
   can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new movies and will interface with
   clients and indexers to grab, sort, and rename them. It can also be
   configured to automatically upgrade the quality of existing files in the
   library when a better quality format becomes available. Note that only one
   type of a given movie is supported. If you want both an 4k version and
   1080p version of a given movie you will need multiple instances.

                                     Setup

   Radarr is best installed as a service on NixOS in your configuration.nix.

   A basic install can be done using the following options:

 services.radarr = {
   enable = true;
   openFirewall = true;
 };

   The openFirewall option is used to open port 7878 on the host firewall.

                             Further configuration

   Radarr can be further configured using NixOS options.

 services.radarr = {
   ...
   user = "user";
   group = "group";
   dataDir = "path/to/directory"
 };

   Both the user and group options are used to specify which user and group
   is used to run Radarr. The dataDir option specifies the directory where
   Radarr stores its data files, and can be set to a custom location. When
   setting the dataDir option, be careful of permissions as a specified user
   still needs the correct read/write permissions in this directory.
