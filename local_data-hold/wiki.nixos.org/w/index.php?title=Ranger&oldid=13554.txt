   Ranger is a command line file manager with a minimalistic vim-inspired
   interface.

Enabling

   To use ranger, add it to configuration.nix:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     #----=[ File Manager ]=----#
     ranger
     ...
 ];

     Tip                                                                      
     In order to affect your system by your nix-language-specific changes you 
     have to evaluate it, run (as root):                                      
                                                                              
     # nixos-rebuild switch                                                   

  Adds file glyphs / icon support to Ranger

   Follow the instructions in: ranger_devicons But before install it, you
   have to install a nerdfont derivations. i suggest to install:
