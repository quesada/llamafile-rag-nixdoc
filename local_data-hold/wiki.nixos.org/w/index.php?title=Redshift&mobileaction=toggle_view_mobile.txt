   From NixOS Wiki

   Redshift is an open-source software application designed to adjust the
   color temperature of computer displays based on the time of day. Created
   by Jon Lund Steffensen, Redshift modifies the color temperature to reduce
   eye strain and improve sleep patterns. This application aims to provide a
   more comfortable viewing experience by dynamically changing the display's
   color temperature to match the user's surrounding light conditions.

   It does this by gradually shifting the color temperature of the display
   from cooler (bluer) tones during the day to warmer (redder) tones at
   night.

   Users have the flexibility to customize various settings in Redshift. They
   can specify custom values for day and night color temperatures, adjust the
   speed of color transitions, and temporarily disable or manually adjust the
   color temperature.

Installation

    Using nix-shell

 nix-shell -p redshift

    Using Global Configuration

 environment.systemPackages = [
   pkgs.redshift
 ];

   After modifying your configuration, apply the changes by running:

 sudo nixos-rebuild switch

    Using Home Configuration

 home.packages = [
   pkgs.redshift
 ];

   After updating your configuration, apply the changes by running:

 home-manager switch

Configuration

    Basic

 services.redshift = {
   enable = true;
   temperature = {
     day = 5500;
     night = 3700;
   };
 };

 services.geoclue2.enable = true;
 location.provider = "geoclue2";

    Advanced

 services.redshift = {
   enable = true;
  
   # Display temperature settings
   temperature = {
     day = 5700;
     night = 3500;
   };
  
   # Location settings (replace with your coordinates)
   latitude = "27.9880614";
   longitude = "86.92521";
  
   # Schedule settings
   settings = {
     dawn-time = "6:00-7:45";
     dusk-time = "18:35-20:15";
   };
  
   # General settings
   brightness = {
     day = "1";
     night = "0.8";
   };
  
   extraOptions = [
     "-v"
     "-m randr"
   ];
 };

 # Setting the location works either by using a provider
 services.geoclue2.enable = true;
 location.provider = "geoclue2";

 # Or like this, which can also be set in services.redshift
 location.latitude = "27.9880614";
 location.longitude = "86.92521";

Tips and Tricks

    Location of Options

   The home manager options are defined in the following Home Manager Options
   Manual.

   The global options are listed on MyNixOS.

    Usage

 # If services.redshift.enable is true, the systemd unit redshift.service is provided.
 # It can either be started by the user level service manager like this:
 systemctl --user start redshift

 # Or permanantly enabled by creating the empty file
 ~/.config/systemd/user/default.target.wants/redshift.service

 # After starting the service, make sure to check its status in the service manager:
 systemctl --user status redshift

Troubleshooting

    Provider is unable to determine location

   It may happen that redshift gets stuck at "Waiting for initial location to
   become available..." when using the geoclue2 location provider. This may
   happen when geoclue is unable to determine your location due to missing
   information. In that case, you may resort to setting the location
   manually.
