   From NixOS Wiki

   You can install retroarch with some cores (actual emulators) by putting
   something like this in your /etc/nixos/configuration.nix:

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
   (retroarch.override {
     cores = with libretro; [
       genesis-plus-gx
       snes9x
       beetle-psx-hw
     ];
   })
 ];

   The cores are defined here:

Gotchas

  Graphics

   Not all the graphics settings are in the same place. You'll want to look
   under the top-level Settings (in the left column under Main Menu) and also
   under Main Menu -> Quick Menu -> Options

  Mapping

   The following way to remap a controller or map a new controller is
   convoluted, but works and allows you to upstream your changes.

    1. Fork the retroarch-joypad-autoconfig project and clone it in a folder
       of your choosing.
    2. With Retroarch open, go to Settings > Directory and change Controller
       Profiles to point to the same folder. Note: Do not attempt to modify
       the directory in retroarch.cfg directly because it will be overwritten
       on startup.
    3. Now, saving the mapping will work but this will be ignored on next
       startup of Retroarch.
    4. After you are happy with the mapping, commit the changes in the folder
       where you cloned the retroarch-joypad-autoconfig project and push them
       to your fork.
    5. To use what you just pushed in your configuration right away, add the
       following overlay to your nix config by replacing the various fields
       with those corresponding to your fork:

 (final: prev: {
   retroarch-joypad-autoconfig = prev.retroarch-joypad-autoconfig.overrideAttrs {
     src = prev.fetchFromGitHub {
       owner = "ibizaman";
       repo = "retroarch-joypad-autoconfig";
       rev = "420a8fa4dc7b12f7c176fa0e704e9f987f6ceabd";
       hash = "sha256-yIvW9UTgc+/hhwx+93FgzrDBEBD35xFdBiVdJCKUYBc=";
     };
   };
 })

    6. After switching over to the new configuration and restarting
       Retroarch, you will see the mappings got updated.
    7. Now you can create a pull request from your fork to the
       retroarch-joypad-autoconfig project to upstream your changes.

Bugs

  Input Reset

   beetle-psx-hw input (by keyboard anyway) only works if you go to Settings
   -> Input -> Port 1 Controls -> Device Type and set it to PlayStation
   Controller every time you run the emulator.

  Missing Icons

   No icons show in the GUI, including the mouse cursor. You need to go to
   Online Updater > Update Assets to download the icons. You can navigate the
   GUI with only the keyboard. Press enter to open sections/pages, backspace
   to go back out, arrow keys to choose between options (left/right change
   some values).

Error Messages

  Error save controller profile

   This is because the location of the controller profile is in the nix
   store, making it read-only. To actually remap a controller, see the
   Mapping section.
