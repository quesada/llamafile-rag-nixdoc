   rsync is a utility for efficiently transferring and synchronizing files
   between a computer and an external hard drive and across networked
   computers by comparing the modification times and sizes of files.

Running a server

   Running rsync via SSH is recommended for security reasons.

   You can restrict an SSH user to rsync command using pkgs.rrsync:

 users.users.backup = {
   isNormalUser = true;
   openssh.authorizedKeys.keys = [
     ''command="${pkgs.rrsync}/bin/rrsync /home/backup/dir/",restrict ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaCetcetera/etceteraJZMfk3QPfQ''
   ];
 };

   Now you should be able to backup to your directory with the rsync client:

 $ rsync -Pav -e "ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/somekeys" photos backup@server:

   See rrsync.1 for additional options, such as enforcing read-only or
   write-only access.
