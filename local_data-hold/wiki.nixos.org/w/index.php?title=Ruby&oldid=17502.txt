Troubleshooting

  Trouble with native dependencies

   Few gems will force include paths for their native dependencies in the
   extconf.rb describing their native dependencies.

   This issue will exhibit symptoms like being unable to find dependencies
   that are made available through nix when building; either through bundix
   or simple bundler calls.

   A simple fix is to fork the gem into an alternative location, apply the
   fix that follows, and then reference the new git repository with fix for
   the gem.

   The fix will probably look like this (for ruby-filemagic):

 diff --git a/ext/filemagic/extconf.rb b/ext/filemagic/extconf.rb
 index 316e0ab979d243d03a967fda962a43b59a1bbdec..062e91d1023a3363962531fc8a54e7f0feb3bc26 100644
