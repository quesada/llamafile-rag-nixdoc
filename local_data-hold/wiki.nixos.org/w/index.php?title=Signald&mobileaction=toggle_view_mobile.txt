   From NixOS Wiki

   Signald is a program that enables users to send and receive end-to-end
   encrypted messages using the Signal protocol. It serves as a bridge
   between the Signal messaging app and other applications or services,
   allowing developers to integrate secure messaging capabilities into their
   own projects.

Installation

   Enable signald daemon, running as the user myuser which should be
   equivalent to the user who should interact with signald

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.signald = {
   enable = true;
   user = "myuser";
 };

 environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.signaldctl ];

  Registration

   Connect and register a phone number of an existing Signal account using
   following command. It will print a QR code which you can scan on your
   mobile device. Navigate to "Settings -> Linked devices" on your mobile
   app.

 # signaldctl account link

   Alternativley register a new real phone number or a virtual disposable one
   which can be bought with services like sms-man.com.

 # signaldctl account register [phone number]

   Sometimes you'll have to generate and supply a captcha verification code
   to this command by using the --captcha parameter. The registration process
   described here might be currently broken, please refer the troubleshooting
   section here for a workaround.

   In the last step, enter the verification number you received via SMS using
   this command

 # signaldctl account verify [phone number] [code]

Usage

  Configuration

   Set profile name of account +12025555555

 # signaldctl account set-profile -a +12025555555 "my signal user"

  Messaging

   Send a message to the recipient number +12026666666 using the account
   +12025555555

 # signaldctl message send -a +12025555555 +12026666666 "hello, joe"

   Send message to a group using the account +12025555555. You'll find the
   group id by generating a group link of an existing group in the settings
   section, for example on your mobile phone with the Signal app.

 # signaldctl message send -a +12025555555 EdSqI90cS0UomDpgUXOlCoObWvQOXlH5G3Z2d3f4ayE= "hello, everyone"

  Group handling

   Join a chat group with the account +12025555555

 # signaldctl group join -a +12025555555 EdSqI90cS0UomDpgUXOlCoObWvQOXlH5G3Z2d3f4ayE=

Troubleshooting

  Registration fails with "error registering with server"

   This registration error might be related to an open bug in Signald. As an
   alternative, it is possible to use the client signal-cli to register and
   verify a new phone number and use Signald as a secondary "device" by
   linking it

 # nix-shell -p nixos.signal-cli
 # Register account with the phone number +12025555555. You'll most likley need to generate a captcha and specify it with a parameter. See registration section above on how to do this.
 # signal-cli -a "+12025555555" register --captcha "abcd"
 Enter the verification number received via SMS
 # signal-cli -a "+12025555555" verify "1234"
 Generate the device uri in Signald to link the existing account
 # signaldctl account link --output-format json
 Use the uri generated above in the following command
 # signal-cli -a "+12025555555" addDevice --uri "abcd"

   Now Signald is able to use the phone number +12025555555, registered with
   signal-cli, as a secondary device.

Tips and tricks

  Python chat bot

   The Python module semaphore can be used to interact with your Signald
   account and to create simple chat bots.
