   From NixOS Wiki

   Sigrok is an open-source cross-platform signal analysis software suite
   that supports device like oscilloscopes, thermometers and other data
   logging devices.

   For Sigrok and Sigrok related software such as PulseView to work properly
   it is necessary to install udev rules that come with the libsigrok
   package. To do so add the following to your config:

 services.udev = {
     enable = true;
     packages = [ pkgs.libsigrok ];
 }
