Setup

   To make slock available, amend /etc/nixos/configuration.nix as follows:

 {
   ...
   programs.slock.enable = true;
   ...
 }

Troubleshooting

  "cannot disable the out-of-memory killer for this process"

   slock requires root for accessing passwords and protecting itself from OOM
   killing. Adding slock to environment.systemPackages is not adequate (nor
   is it necessary); slock should be enabled via the provided NixOS module
   via the means shown above.
