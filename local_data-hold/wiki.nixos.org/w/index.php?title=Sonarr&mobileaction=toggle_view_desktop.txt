   From NixOS Wiki

   Sonarr is a PVR for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple
   RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort and
   rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the
   quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes
   available.

                                     Setup

   Sonarr is best installed as a service on NixOS in your configuration.nix.

   A basic install can be done using the following options:

 services.sonarr = {
   enable = true;
   openFirewall = true;
 };

   The openFirewall option is used to open port 8989 on the host firewall.

                             Further configuration

   Sonarr can be further configured using NixOS options.

 services.sonarr = {
   ...
   user = "user";
   group = "group";
   dataDir = "path/to/directory"
 };

   Both the user and group options are used to specify which user and group
   is used to run Sonarr. The dataDir option specifies the directory where
   Sonarr stores its data files, and can be set to a custom location. When
   setting the dataDir option, be careful of permissions as a specified user
   still needs the correct read/write permissions in this directory.
