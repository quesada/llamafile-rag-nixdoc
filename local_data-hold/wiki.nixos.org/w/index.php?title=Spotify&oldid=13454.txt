   Note: This package is unfree and requires extra steps to install.

   Spotify is a commercial music streaming service.

Installation

   To install the standard Spotify desktop application, add to system
   packages:

  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    spotify
  ];

Local discovery

   To sync local tracks from your filesystem with mobile devices in the same
   network, you need to open port 57621 by adding the following line to your
   configuration.nix:

 networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts = [ 57621 ];

   In order to enable discovery of Google Cast devices (and possibly other
   Spotify Connect devices) in the same network by the Spotify app, you need
   to open UDP port 5353 by adding the following line to your
   configuration.nix:

 networking.firewall.allowedUDPPorts = [ 5353 ];

Spotifyd

   The alternative client spotifyd is available as a package, nixos module,
   and home-manager module.

   spotifyd must have your credentials when it starts, otherwise it will not
   be able to authenticate with Spotify, and will not show up as a device. If
   installing spotifyd as a package, give it credentials when starting, e.g.:

 spotifyd --username <USER> --password <PASS>

   If installing spotifyd as a systemd service via home-manager, you can
   supply your credentials via options. Example home-manager config:

  services.spotifyd = {
    enable = true;
    settings =
      {
        global = {
          username = "Alex";
          password = "foo";
        };
      }
    ;
  }

   spotifyd connects to spotify as a spotify-connect device. It offers no
   controls of its own, but can be controlled via playerctl or spotify-tui.

  Troubleshooting

   If you get: libcurl-gnutls.so.4: no version information, clear your
   Spotify cache: rm -rf ~/.cache/spotify
