   From NixOS Wiki

   Star Citizen is playable on NixOS, thanks to a few community projects. In
   case you have issues, over there is a good place to start

     * Robertsspaceindustries.com - LUG (Linux User Group)
     * GitHub - fufexan/nix-gaming

RAM, ZRAM & Swap

   Bad news: Star Citizen requires a lot of RAM on Linux

   Good news: ZRAM & Swap count! For the correct amounts, please see GitHub -
   starcitizen-lug/knowledge-base/wiki/Performance-Tuning#zram--swap

Example config

   The below config is for a system with 16 GB of RAM. Adjust the ZRAM & Swap
   values as needed.

 { config, pkgs, ... }:

 let
   nix-gaming = import (builtins.fetchTarball "https://github.com/fufexan/nix-gaming/archive/master.tar.gz");
 in
 {
   # ...

   # See https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/knowledge-base/wiki/Manual-Installation#prerequisites
   boot.kernel.sysctl = {
     "vm.max_map_count" = 16777216;
     "fs.file-max" = 524288;
   };

   # See RAM, ZRAM & Swap
   swapDevices = [{
     device = "/var/lib/swapfile";
     size = 8 * 1024;  # 8 GB Swap
   }];
   zramSwap = {
     enable = true;
     memoryMax = 16 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024;  # 16 GB ZRAM
   };

   # The following line was used in my setup, but I'm unsure if it is still needed
   # hardware.pulseaudio.extraConfig = "load-module module-combine-sink";

   users.users.foo = {
     isNormalUser = true;
     description = "Foo";
     packages = with pkgs; [
       # tricks override to fix audio
       # see https://github.com/fufexan/nix-gaming/issues/165#issuecomment-2002038453
       (nix-gaming.packages.${pkgs.hostPlatform.system}.star-citizen.override {
         tricks = [ "arial" "vcrun2019" "win10" "sound=alsa" ];
       })
     ];
   };

   # ...
 }
