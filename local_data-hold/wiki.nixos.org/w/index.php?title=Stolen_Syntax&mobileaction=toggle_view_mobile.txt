   From NixOS Wiki

   The Nix language allows any name to be used in an attribute set, but Nix,
   some libraries, and the ecosystem in general assign special meaning to
   some names that appear in attribute sets that consist of otherwise freely
   named variables.

   This page presents a cross-section of well known "keywords" used in
   attribute sets in various components.

   Since neither the runtime, not the language reserve these keywords, these
   keywords are described stolen rather than reserved.

Nix language

     * outPath
     * __functor
     * __toString

nix-build

     * recurseForDerivations

The wider ecosystem

     * _type for nominal typing. Should contain a string. Pioneered by the
       module system (?)
     * ~type~ in principle this one is available for domain specific use!
       That is, unless you want the attrset to double as a "derivation" in
       the CLI.

Module system

     * _type
     * config, options (etc) (switches away from shorthand syntax)
     * _module option tree is omitted from the returned config and is
       intended for module system specific use
     * _key
     * _class
     * _file
     * ...
