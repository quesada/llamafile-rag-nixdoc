   From NixOS Wiki

   This page is intended to explain how to use Sunshine, an open-source
   implementation of NVIDIA’s GameStream protocol.

Install

   To install Sunshine and enable it you can use the following snippet:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

   services.sunshine = {
     enable = true;
     autoStart = true;
     capSysAdmin = true; # only needed for Wayland -- omit this when using with Xorg
     openFirewall = true;
   };

   For manual Firewall configuration you can open network ports as shown
   here:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 networking.firewall = {
   enable = true;
   allowedTCPPorts = [ 47984 47989 47990 48010 ];
   allowedUDPPortRanges = [
     { from = 47998; to = 48000; }
     { from = 8000; to = 8010; }
   ];
 };

Connecting to the host

   When installed via the NixOS module, Sunshine is configured as a Systemd
   user unit, and will start automatically on login to a graphical session.
   Note that a logout/login or restart may be required for Sunshine to start
   after initially adding it to your configuration due to limitations of
   NixOS' handling of user units with nixos-rebuild.

   If services.sunshine.autoStart is set to false, Sunshine needs to be
   started with the

 sunshine

   command.

   You may have to manually add the host running Sunshine to your Moonlight
   client. This, thankfully, is not hard to do.

   Simply press the button that says Add Host Manually, from there you will
   need to input the following (replace <Host IP> with your Host’s IP
   address):

   <Host IP>:47989

   If this doesn’t work you should double check the port in the Sunshine’s
   WebGUI. You can access this from the Host PC in a web browser
   https://localhost:47990

   A substantial amount of the above came from this fairly wonderful guide
   posted to Reddit.
