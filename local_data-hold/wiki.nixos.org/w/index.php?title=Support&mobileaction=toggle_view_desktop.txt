   From NixOS Wiki

   This article outlines how to best go about getting support. It is
   recommended to make sure you try these measures in this order, moving on
   to the next measure only when the previous has been exhausted.

  1. Check the documentation

   In addition to the reference documentation and introductory materials on
   nix.dev, and NixOS user documentation in this Wiki, there is a wealth of
   unofficial documentation available. For an overview of all these
   resources, see our resource overview article. It is a good idea to look
   into the manual(s) too:

     * NixOS manual
     * Nix manual
     * Nixpkgs manual
     * Hydra manual

  2. Have a chat

   The #users:nixos.org channel on the Matrix network is very active, and is
   one of your best shots at getting live support; if you don't have an
   Matrix client you can check out our Get In Touch page for alternatives.

  3. Post your issue

   If your issue is technical and possibly a bug, you can report the issue on
   the Nixpkgs GitHub repository. For other questions, you could try the
   official discourse instance, stack overflow, or the NixOS Reddit channel.

  4. Hire a pro

   If all else fails, you can hire a professional Nix consultant; see the
   list of Nix consultants
