   about zram as an option for swap on nixos)

Configuration

   Swap on NixOS is set with with one of two options swapDevices or
   zramSwap.enable on /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix.

  Add a Swapfile

   Add a swapfile with the following :

  swapDevices = [ {
     device = "/var/lib/swapfile";
     size = 16*1024;
   } ];

   Size is in megabytes

  Disable swap

   To remove all swap devices from NixOS, set the following to remove the
   swap partition or file from being included in /etc/fstab.

 swapDevices = lib.mkForce [ ];

   If you are using GPT partitioning tables, systemd-gpt-auto-generator(8)
   will still mount your swap partition automatically. You must therefore
   turn on attribute 63 on your partition in the partition table. This can be
   done with gptfdisk or similar:

 gdisk /dev/sda
 x
 a
 <partition number>
 63
 <enter>
 w

  Enable zram swap

   Zram is a kernel module for creating a compressed block device in RAM. The
   option zramSwap.enable creates such a zram block device and uses it as
   swap device.

   It is an alternative or complementary approach to swap disks, suitable for
   systems with enough RAM. In the event the system needs to swap it will
   move uncompressed RAM contents into the compressed area, saving RAM space
   while effectively increasing the available RAM at the cost of
   computational power for compression and decompression.

  Encrypt swap with random key

   Swap can be automatically encrypted with a new key on every boot. This can
   be used to simplify certain disk layouts, such as securing a swap file on
   a filesystem partition without an encryption container (such as LUKS).

  swapDevices = [ {
     device = "/dev/sdXY";
     randomEncryption.enable = true;
   } ];

  ZFS and Swap

   OpenZFS does not support swap on zvols nor do they support swapfiles on a
   ZFS dataset.

   Instead you should set up a swap partition or swapfile on a non-ZFS
   filesystem.^[1]
