   From NixOS Wiki

   Syncthing is a decentralized file synchronization service. You can use it
   to safely sync all files in a folder between different desktops/servers.

Setup

   To enable Syncthing, add the following to your system configuration:

 services.syncthing = {
   enable = true;
   openDefaultPorts = true;
   settings.gui = {
     user = "myuser";
     password = "mypassword";
   };
 };

   You can confirm Syncthing runs by visiting http://127.0.0.1:8384/ and
   authenticating using the credentials above.

Configuration

  Sync folders and trusted remote hosts

   The following configuration will trust the remote hosts device1 and
   device2 by adding their ids. The shares Documents and Example are added to
   the local node, defined by their local file paths and list of allowed
   devices.

 services.syncthing = {
   settings = {
     devices = {
       "device1" = { id = "DEVICE-ID-GOES-HERE"; };
       "device2" = { id = "DEVICE-ID-GOES-HERE"; };
     };
     folders = {
       "Documents" = {
         path = "/home/myusername/Documents";
         devices = [ "device1" "device2" ];
       };
       "Example" = {
         path = "/home/myusername/Example";
         devices = [ "device1" ];
         # By default, Syncthing doesn't sync file permissions. This line enables it for this folder.
         ignorePerms = false;
       };
     };
   };
 };

  Declarative node IDs

   If you set up Syncthing with the above configuration, you will still need
   to manually accept the connection from your other devices. If you want to
   make this automatic, you must also set the key.pem and cert.pem options:

 services = {
   syncthing = {
     key = "${</path/to/key.pem>}";
     cert = "${</path/to/cert.pem>}";
     ...
 };

   This will ensure your node has a stable ID.

   You can optionally include the key.pem and cert.pem files in the NixOS
   configuration using a tool like sops-nix. See Comparison of secret
   managing schemes.

   To generate a new key.cert and key.pem for a deployment, you can use the
   -generate argument:

 $ nix-shell -p syncthing --run "syncthing -generate=myconfig"
 2024/04/23 11:41:17 INFO: Generating ECDSA key and certificate for syncthing...
 2024/04/23 11:41:17 INFO: Device ID: DMWVMM6-MKEQVB4-I4UZTRH-5A6E24O-XHQTL3K-AAI5R5L-MXNMUGX-QTGRHQ2
 2024/04/23 11:41:17 INFO: Default folder created and/or linked to new config
 $ ls myconfig/
 cert.pem  config.xml  key.pem

Tips and tricks

  Disable default sync folder

   Syncthing creates a 'Sync' folder in your home directory every time it
   regenerates a configuration, even if your declarative configuration does
   not have this folder. You can disable that by setting the
   STNODEFAULTFOLDER environment variable:

 systemd.services.syncthing.environment.STNODEFAULTFOLDER = "true"; # Don't create default ~/Sync folder
