   Doesn't mention that you need to install bluetoothctl, by adding bluez
   bluez-tools.

   One of the "See Also" links, Scripting PulseAudio, Bluetooth, JACK is
   dead, and Internet Archive's Wayback Machine doesn't seem to have a cached
   copy (most try to follow a redirect, the oldest copy is some XML error).
   If anyone has a live version or a similar resource that we can put in the
   place of the current link, that would be great. --Chance (talk) 09:18, 14
