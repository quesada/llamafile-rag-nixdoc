   the table is overly long and requires scrolling left and right, not sure
   how to make the page show it all without the need for scrolling --Makefu

     * I added a notice to use the Vector wiki theme for easier viewing of
       this specific page. We can remove it once the problem is resolved.

   I'm sure it's a bit early to convert this to use the new `nix` command but
   wanted to get a sense of when people think a good time for that would be.
   Perhaps we could start building the content on another page now, linked
   from this one? --Abrooks (talk) 17:45, 10 April 2018 (UTC)Reply

     * due to the fact that nix2 is now the new default for 18.03 and 17.09
       is unsupported i think we should just rewrite the parts which need
       rewriting. also most of the stuff should still *just work* --Makefu

   Am I ok to add a big caveat to the `nix-env -iA` example, stating that it
   should not be used? I've just run into my umphteenth case of "user
   confused by package not updating because they installed it into their
   profile", and I suspect a lot of this usage comes from people finding this
   cheat sheet:

   The search commands don't really work. Most things that can be installed
   will not be listed by these commands.

   The 7 July edit to "move comparison table to Ubuntu vs. NixOS" has removed
   almost all the utility of this page for me. There is now almost no
   difference between this page and a dozen other "I assume you already know
   NixOS so..." pages that are out there, including the official manual. Is
   there any particular reason why that was moved? Cynic (talk)
