   userPackages example)

   I fixed the syntax in the section on "How can I manage software with
   nix-env like with configuration.nix?" but it still doesn't work for me and
   there are lines of code there that are not explained (so probably should
   be bu I don't understand).

   ```

      inherit ((import <nixpkgs/nixos> {}).config.system.path)
      pathsToLink ignoreCollisions postBuild;
      extraOutputsToInstall = [ "man" ];

   ```

   What does all that mean? And is it compulsory? If I leave it in I get
   this:

   ``` $ nix-env -iA userPackages -f '<nixpkgs>' installing 'user-packages'
   error: file 'nixos-config' was not found in the Nix search path (add it
   using $NIX_PATH or -I), at
   /home/dsyer/.nix-defexpr/channels/nixpkgs/nixos/default.nix:1:60 (use
   '--show-trace' to show detailed location information ```

   If I remove it I get:

   ``` $ nix-env -iA userPackages -f '<nixpkgs>' installing 'user-packages'
   building
   '/nix/store/59z3yxcxnm2cs2922gwnjk882v5n9rk9-user-environment.drv'...
   error: packages
   '/nix/store/fjm4sqv4ms737c7jsv36l3y8b320vqfg-git-2.25.1/share/man/man7/gittutorial-2.7.gz'
   and
   '/nix/store/5yxbj5d6w10rrxi9r33954qayxyipykf-git-2.25.1/share/man/man7/gittutorial-2.7.gz'
   have the same priority 5; use 'nix-env --set-flag priority NUMBER
   INSTALLED_PKGNAME' to change the priority of one of the conflicting
   packages (0 being the highest priority) builder for
   '/nix/store/59z3yxcxnm2cs2922gwnjk882v5n9rk9-user-environment.drv' failed
   with exit code 1 error: build of
   '/nix/store/59z3yxcxnm2cs2922gwnjk882v5n9rk9-user-environment.drv' failed
   ```
