   A lot of the attributes listed in the schema are out of date.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    1. Using flakes with NixOS

   looks like upgrading NixOS when using flakes now requires

   ``` $ nixos-rebuild switch --upgrade --recreate-lock-file ```

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   I noticed that a lot of people complain that flakes are hard to
   understand. The first paragraph of this article used to be very confusing
   and didn't really capture what I feel flakes are truly about. I've
   rewritten it to be more direct about the local locking of dependencies,
   which is what I see as the truly essential flake feature. -- User:Sid-code

Making it more legible for newcomers

   There are a couple of changes I'd love to see to start, but the whole
   article overall needs a revamp.

   1. A section explaining how flakes are relevant for desktop use 2. A basic
   example flake for people to look at and use on their own system, with
   comments explaining what each line does

   There will come a time when flakes aren't experimental, and such widely
   used features will need good, easy to understand documentation.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   The user guide documentation needs to resist diving into reference style
   rabbit holes at every step. I'm trying to get a simple flake based project
   running but I find I need to read about _all_ the options for flake
   schema. It seems like there are better places for that information. And,
   BTW, `nix flake init` works but no subsequent flake command works and I
   don't know what to do next. I'll figure it out, but probably not using
   this documentation. — User:Dani2620
