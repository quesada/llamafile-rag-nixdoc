   (Tomodachi94 moved page Talk:Home manager to Talk:Home Manager over
   redirect: Misspelled title: the spelling "Home Manager" is consistently
   used in documentation:
   https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager?tab=readme-ov-file#home-manager-using-nix)

   Looks like the nixos module usage is different from that suggested in the
   documentation:
   https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.html#sec-install-nixos-module

   Why is that?

   @Onny Things changed, I guess. We should not document how to use
   independently developed software here. If you see NixOS wiki pages
   outdated w.r.t. official documentation, remove that information.
