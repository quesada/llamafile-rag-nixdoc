   Declarative hydra, spec files, details should be added to the page.

Testing performance / jobset

   Latest comment: 31 December 20171 comment1 person in discussion

   This may be of interest to integrate in the article:

     if you want to test hydra performance without fully configuring hydra,
     just try these 2 commands

 nix-build '<nixpkgs>' -A hydra
 ./result/bin/hydra-eval-jobs -I ~/nixpkgs/ ~/nixpkgs/pkgs/top-level/release.nix

     it will spit out a giant blob of json, chew up 4gig of ram, and write
     .drv files for every single package to the store
