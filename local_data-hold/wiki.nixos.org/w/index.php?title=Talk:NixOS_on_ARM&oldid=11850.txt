NixOS "support" for board-specific kernels or bootloaders

   Latest comment: 21 January 20181 comment1 person in discussion

   I re-worked the introduction paragraph of the article, but I have added a
   partly unfounded remark about NixOS being able to work with specific
   kernels or bootloaders. The remark is built on the fact that there is a
   raspberry pi specific image using a specific kernel, that it is possible
   to use upstream forks with fixes for the kernel. There is no documentation
   yet on how to use a vendor fork (e.g. allwinner non-upstream fork) for the
   kernel or u-boot, and no documentation on how to boot NixOS when extlinux
   support isn't present in the u-boot build.

   This isn't perfect, but fresh from nixpkgs-unstable.

Distributed Builds

   Latest comment: 11 July 20191 comment1 person in discussion

   I've added a short section about using an aarch64 remote builder to speed
   up builds for armv6l and armv7l (With the advent of the raspberry pi 4,
   this is probably a relatively convenient way to run nixos on the raspberry
   pi 1 / raspberry pi zero(w) without suffering very long build times). It
   might make sense to merge it with the section on cross-compiling with
   qemu, which also mentions distributed builds briefly, but I wasn't sure
   how best to do it.

Option boot.loader.grub.devices

   I am currently trying to setup a Raspberry Pi and neither on the ARM
   installation page, the default configuration, nor this page here, does the
   required option "boot.loader.grub.devices" come up.

   With my configuration, the system requires me to set this.

   This is my configuration:
