Replace GitHub instructions with links

   Latest comment: 8 June 20182 comments2 people in discussion

   Should we replace the subsections Fork Nixpkgs on Github to Create a pull
   request on GitHub with links to relevant pages on GitHub? Their
   documentation is probably better than something we would produce. And
   it'll stay up-to-date with changes on Github.

   1. Join GitHub

   2. Fork a repo

   3. Creating and deleting branches within your repository

   4. About pull requests

   There are some nix specific parts that should still be kept in the
   article. Like how to build a package using the git repository from source
   and `Becoming a Nixpkgs maintainer`
