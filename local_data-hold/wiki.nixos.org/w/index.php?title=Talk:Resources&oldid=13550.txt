Shelving the old article table

   Reworking the main page so we're not highlighting a bunch of dead links.
   Putting the old table article table here. Can bring it back in if it fills
   out more, though I think Reference will stick to official manual links.

   The goal is to eventually have strong articles for every entry of this
   table, but initial efforts will target the first row and first column.

Blogs?

   There are plenty of NixOS blogs. Should they have their own page or own
   heading on this page?
