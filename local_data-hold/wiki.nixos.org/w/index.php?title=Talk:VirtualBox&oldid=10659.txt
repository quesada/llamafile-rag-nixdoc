   From NixOS Wiki
   Revision as of 08:10, 24 April 2023 by imported>Akaihola (nixpkgs#71127 is
   closed and not merged, but still recommended on the page)

   One of the offered solutions to frequent recompilation when using Oracle
   VirtualBox Extensions is:

     Use module from https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/71127 (unsafe) if
     you'd like to avoid recompilation.

   However, it seems that pull request was never merged and got closed since
   the author doesn't use VirtualBox anymore.

   Can the approach still be used without patching NixOS, or should we
   reconsidering the inclusion of this link on the page?
