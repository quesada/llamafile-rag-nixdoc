  pcscd is not strictly required

   I've had my fair share of problems with the pcscd, namely that it often
   required restarts to function. Fortunately I noticed that gpg-agent can
   work without it just fine. The only thing standing in my way was a missing
   udev rule for the Yubikey Neo:

     # Yubikey 4/5 U2F+CCID
     SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1050", ATTR{idProduct}=="0406", ENV{ID_SECURITY_TOKEN}="1", GROUP="wheel"

   I'm not putting this in the main article as it'd probably need an invasive
   edit since it mentions pcscd everywhere.

  udev setup

   I needed to set up udev to make the Yubikeys readable as well. My solution
   was to: 1 . Add libfido2 to services.dev.udev.packages 2. Create
   `users.groups.plugdev = {};` and add my user to the `plugdev` group.

pkgs.yubikey-personalization seems outdated

   pkgs.yubikey-personalization afik is for yubikey series 1 and 2. No idea
   what the replacement for 5 Series and Bio is, but it ain't that.
