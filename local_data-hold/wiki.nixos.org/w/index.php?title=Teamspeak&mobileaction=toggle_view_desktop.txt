   From NixOS Wiki

   Teamspeak is an unfree voice chat application mainly used for online
   games. It is available as client, but its also possible to host an (older)
   version of Teamspeak as server service.

                                 Install client

   To install the client just add the package:

   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     teamspeak_client
   ];

                                 Install server

   To install a Teamspeak3 server with NixOS for up to 32 users:

   services.teamspeak3 = {
     enable = true;
     openFirewall = true;
   };

   Because teamspeak has an unfree licence, you also need to accept that
   manually. Place the following in your config in order to do so.

 { nixpkgs.config.allowUnfreePredicate = pkg: builtins.elem (lib.getName pkg) [
    "teamspeak-server"
  ];
 }

   Teamspeak has several additional options for configuration. To get
   elevated rights on the server, it is needed to use the ServerAdmin
   privilege key from the first log in /var/log/teamspeak3-server.
