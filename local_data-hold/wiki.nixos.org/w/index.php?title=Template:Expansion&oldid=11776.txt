   This page is a template. It should be used as part of other articles. For
   more information, see Help:Template.

   Please do not experiment with this template; you could ruin all pages
   using this template. If you want to edit this template, copy the text to
   Template:Sandbox, edit and test it there, and copy it back when it works.

   Feel free to discuss this template in the talk page.

   If you wanted to create a new page instead, use the search box to search
   for the title of the new page you want to create and follow the link
   Create the page "XYZ" on this wiki! in the results page. An alternative is
   to create a dangling link to the new page from an existing page. A final
   option is to directly visit the expected URL of the page.

About

   An expansion flag used to indicate incomplete articles.

Usage

   This template should be added at the beginning of articles or sections
   lacking in detail. Ensure to cite specific concerns with the first
   argument and possibly also on the flagged article's discussion page.

 {{Expansion|reason}}

   You can override the default discussion page with a second optional
   argument:

 {{Expansion|reason|Talk:Alternative Page}}

   Alternatively you can point to a specific section in the default talk page
   with the named section parameter:

 {{Expansion|reason|section=Section name}}

   Flagged pages can be found in Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Expansion or
   in Category:Pages or sections flagged with Template:Expansion. If
   knowledgeable in a subject, users are encouraged to participate to expand
   the article or section and remove the {{Expansion}} flag when finished.

   Note: The talk page is linked through an external link: this is to avoid
   polluting Special:WantedPages when the talk page does not exist.

Example

 {{Expansion|This is just a demonstration template.}}

    This article or section needs expansion.                                  
    Reason: This is just a demonstration template. (Discuss in Template
