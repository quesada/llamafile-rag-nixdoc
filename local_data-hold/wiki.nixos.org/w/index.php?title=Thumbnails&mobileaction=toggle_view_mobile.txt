    This article or section needs expansion.                                  
    Reason: Explain how thumbnails can be configured in different file        
    managers, preferably by linking to their articles (Discuss in             
    Talk:Thumbnails#)

Creating custom thumbnailers

   Most package mangers accept the Thumbnail Managing Standard, by using it
   you can create your own thumbnailer for any file format, this can be done
   by:

    1. First you need to figure out how to create a .png image from a file in
       the desired format.
    2. Create a .thumbnailer file in $XDG_DATA_DIRS/thumbnailers.
    3. Restart your thumbnailer service (This is specific to each file
       manager) and test if it's working.

  Example

   You could create a thumbnailer for Krita's .kra file format like so:

   .kra are zip files, with a preview stored at /preview.png, we can use
   unzip to extract the preview:

 unzip -p robot-squirrel.kra preview.png > robot-squirrel.png

   Create a .thumbnailer file in any $XDG_DATA_DIRS/thumbnailers directory.

 # $HOME/.local/share/thumbnailers/kra.thumbnailer
 [Thumbnailer Entry]
 Exec=sh -c "unzip -p %i preview.png > %o"
 MimeType=application/x-krita;

   Restart your thumbnailer service (This is specific to each file manager)
   and test if it's working.

   After you have a working definition, you can make it reproducible like so:

 # configuration.nix
 { pkgs, ... }: {
   environment.systemPackages = [
     (
       pkgs.writeTextFile {
         # This can be anything, it's just the name of the derivation in the nix store
         name = "krita-thumbnailer";
         # This is the important part, the path under which this will be installed
         destination = "/share/thumbnailers/kra.thumbnailer";
         # The contents of your thumbnailer, don't forget to specify the full path to executables
         text = ''
           [Thumbnailer Entry]
           Exec=sh -c "${pkgs.unzip}/bin/unzip -p %i preview.png > %o"
           MimeType=application/x-krita;
         '';
       }
     )
   ];
 }

  FFmpeg thumbnailer

   On minimal GNOME environments (for example ones with the option
   services.gnome.core-utilities.enable set to false, or ones without
   pkgs.gnome.totem), video thumbnails do not work by default. To fix this,
   you can use ffmpegthumbnailer:

 # configuration.nix
 { pkgs, ... }: {
   environment.systemPackages = [
     pkgs.ffmpegthumbnailer
   ];
 }
