   Here are a few steps to run Tor Browser in NixOS Container w/ Pulse, Media
   Support. Most of the time, ssh -X would have sufficed. Nevertheless, to
   route audio, the following is required.

 containers.browser = {
   autoStart = false;
   privateNetwork = true;
   hostAddress = "192.168.7.10";
   localAddress = "192.168.7.11";
   config = {config, pkgs, ... }: {
     services.openssh = {
       enable = true;
       forwardX11 = true;
     };

     users.extraUsers.browser = {
       isNormalUser = true;
       home = "/home/browser";
       openssh.authorizedKeys.keys = [ SSH-KEYS-GO-HERE ];
       extraGroups = ["audio" "video"];
     };
   };
 };

 # Open necessary ports
 networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts = [ 4713 6000 ];
 hardware.pulseaudio = {
   enable = true;
   systemWide = true;
   support32Bit = true;
   tcp = { enable = true; anonymousClients = { allowedIpRanges = ["127.0.0.1" "192.168.7.0/24"]; }; };
 };

 # Configuring NAT
 networking.nat.enable = true;
 networking.nat.internalInterfaces = ["ve-browser"];
 networking.nat.externalInterface = "YOUR-EXTERNAL-INTERFACE";

 # Depending on your use of global or home configuration, you will have to install "socat"
 environment.systemPackages = [
   pkgs.socat
 ];

   Mind to fill the SSH keys in. Then, follow the steps:

 nixos-rebuild switch

 nixos-container start browser # switch "start" with "root-login" for root

   Now the container should be in a sane state to work on. Install the
   browser and apulse:

 [root@browser:~]$ su - browser
 [browser@browser:~]$ nix repl
 Welcome to Nix version 2.2. Type :? for help.

 nix-repl> pkgs = import <nixpkgs> {}
 nix-repl> :i pkgs.callPackage <nixpkgs/pkgs/applications/networking/browsers/tor-browser-bundle-bin> { mediaSupport = true; pulseaudioSupport = true; }
 installing 'tor-browser-bundle-bin-8.0.6.drv'
 nix-repl> :i pkgs.callPackage <nixpkgs/pkgs/misc/apulse> {}
 installing 'apulse-0.1.11.1.drv'
 these paths will be fetched (0.04 MiB download, 0.20 MiB unpacked):
   /nix/store/mi6kyfjymb3bdpwic3hy9y64hv21hflc-apulse-0.1.11.1
 copying path '/nix/store/mi6kyfjymb3bdpwic3hy9y64hv21hflc-apulse-0.1.11.1' from 'https://cache.nixos.org'...
 building '/nix/store/r00d47r40v7mhblly9rqas434x2d53js-user-environment.drv'...
 created 121 symlinks in user environment
 nix-repl>

   The following two scripts are needed. Put them in ~/bin or any other
   directory included in the path.

 # run-tor-browser.sh (executed by the host)

 #!/bin/sh
 socat -d TCP-LISTEN:6000,fork,bind=192.168.7.10 UNIX-CONNECT:/tmp/.X11-unix/X0 &
 xhost +
 ssh -X browser@192.168.7.11 run-tor-browser.sh

 # run-tor-browser.sh (executed in the container (guest) by the previous one executed on the host)

 #!/bin/sh
 PULSE_SERVER=tcp:192.168.7.10:4713 XAUTHORITY="/home/browser/.Xauthority" DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS="" DISPLAY=192.168.7.10:0.0 apulse tor-browser $@

   Now you should be able to run the browser in a container and have media
   and audio support. Alternatively, you could use Xpra over SSH

 xpra start ssh://browser@192.168.7.11/ --start=tor-browser
