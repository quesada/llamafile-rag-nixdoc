    This article or section needs expansion.                                  
    Reason: This article is a stub. (Discuss in Talk:Unbound#)                
    Please consult the pedia article metapage for guidelines on contributing. 

Example configuration

 services.unbound = {
     enable = true;
     settings = {
       server = {
         # When only using Unbound as DNS, make sure to replace 127.0.0.1 with your ip address
         # When using Unbound in combination with pi-hole or Adguard, leave 127.0.0.1, and point Adguard to 127.0.0.1:PORT
         interface = [ "127.0.0.1" ];
         port = 5335;
         access-control = [ "127.0.0.1 allow" ];
         # Based on recommended settings in https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/unbound/#configure-unbound
         harden-glue = true;
         harden-dnssec-stripped = true;
         use-caps-for-id = false;
         prefetch = true;
         edns-buffer-size = 1232;

         # Custom settings
         hide-identity = true;
         hide-version = true;
       };
       forward-zone = [
         # Example config with quad9
         {
           name = ".";
           forward-addr = [
             "9.9.9.9#dns.quad9.net"
             "149.112.112.112#dns.quad9.net"
