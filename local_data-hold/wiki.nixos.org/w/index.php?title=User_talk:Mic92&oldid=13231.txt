   - Hey Mic92, thank you for your work in the NixOS wiki! I saw that you
   removed the page "Nix command/run" because it is now part of the NixOS
   manual. I really was used to look up these information on the wiki while
   continuously improving the pages etc. I know the NixOS manual is the main
   resource for up to date documentation but personally I have my
   difficulties using and accessing it. I wasn't able to find the entry about
   nix run there. I somehow prefer the Wiki and in my opinion it is the
   resource which is easier to access for most users. For example the pages
   on Dokuwiki, Nextcloud and Wordpress improved a lot. Do you think it could
   be possible to have documentation on both sides, manual and wiki while
   risking duplication and contradicting doc? - onny

   - I was deleting those on request on the documentation team. Maybe it's
   best to discuss this with them. You can participating in their meetings or
   reach out to fricklerhandwerk in matrix in #nixos-wiki:matrix.org

   Hello Mic92,

   I've noticed your excellent contributions to the MPV page and I fully
   acknowledge that the nix-env section was an oversight on my part. Your
   efforts in organizing the page and improving its readability are greatly
   appreciated.

   However, I have concerns about merging the "mpv scripts" section. I'm not
   sure if you are using the latest channel, but it appears that I cannot
   build it on my system, and I wonder if this issue is related to the
   channel you're using. Layer-09 (talk) 11:27, 19 June 2024 (UTC)Reply
