NixOS as VMWare Guest

  VMWare Video Driver

   Enable vmware video driver for better performance:

 services.xserver.videoDrivers = [ "vmware" ];

  VMware Guest Tools

   Enable VMWare guest tools:

 virtualisation.vmware.guest.enable = true;

   And note that file copying, pasting, and dragging between guest and host
   are only supported on Xorg, not Wayland.

   For example, in the GDM and GNOME desktop environments, to use Xorg, click
   on the settings button at the bottom right corner of the login screen and
   select the "GNOME on Xorg" option.

Troubleshooting

  Guest issues

   This section covers issues you might have running NixOS as a guest VM in
   VMware Workstation or similar.

    Display issues

      Cannot change resolution in KDE Plasma ISO

   If you are unable to change resolution in a guest VM while booted into the
   NixOS Plasma graphical installer ISO...

   This appears to be an issue where if KScreen is running as a service it
   will instantly revert to the default resolution [1].

   Disabling the KScreen 2 Service under Background Services allows
   resolution settings to apply properly.

   If you continue to have issues, running journalctl should print a system
   log with debug info which might help in resolving the issue.

    Mouse issues

      Mouse buttons above 5 do not work

   If your mouse's thumb buttons or other additional buttons do not work, set
   guest to use advanced mouse. For your NixOS-based guest VM, add the below
   lines to its .vmx configuration file:

  mouse.vusb.enable = "TRUE"
  mouse.vusb.useBasicMouse = "FALSE"
