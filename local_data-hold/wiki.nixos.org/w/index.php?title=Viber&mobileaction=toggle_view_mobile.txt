   From NixOS Wiki

   Viber is an instant messaging and Voice over IP (VoIP) app.

Installation

   Install the viber package.

Wayland

  Missing window

   The app may not launch properly on Wayland - the tray icon will appear
   though there will be no way to show the window. To fix this set the
   QT_QPA_PLATFORM environment variable to xcb.

  Scaling

   If you have a HiDPI screen, you may want to scale the app. You can do this
   by setting the QT_SCALE_FACTOR environment variable to an appropriate
   number (e.g. 1.75).
