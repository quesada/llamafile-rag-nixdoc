 * First run <code>./update.py</code>.

 * Commit the changes with the commit message "vimPlugins: Update".

 * Add your plugin to ./vim-plugin-names (please try to maintain the list             
 alphabetically sorted). You can customize the branch by appending for example        
 <code>@main</code> to an entry (search the file for examples)                        
                                                                                      
 <!--T:96-->                                                                          
 * Run <code>./update.py</code> once again to generate the plugin's nix expression.   
                                                                                      
 <!--T:97-->                                                                          
 * Commit your changes one more time, this time with the message formated as such:    
 "vimPlugins.[plugin-name]: init at [version]".                                       
                                                                                      
 <!--T:98-->                                                                          
 * If you need to add additional code/patches to the generated code, add those lines  
 to <code>pkgs/misc/vim-plugins/vim2nix/additional-nix-code</code> and rerun          
 <code>./update.py</code>. They will be included in the generated code.
