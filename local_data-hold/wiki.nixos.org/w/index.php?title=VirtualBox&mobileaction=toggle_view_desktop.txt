   VirtualBox is a virtualisation hypervisor. It has powerful a GUI included
   for managing virtual machines.

NixOS Installation

   VirtualBox can be installed on NixOS without problems, put this snippet in
   your configuration.nix

 {
    virtualisation.virtualbox.host.enable = true;
    users.extraGroups.vboxusers.members = [ "user-with-access-to-virtualbox" ];
 }

   Adding users to the group vboxusers allows them to use the virtualbox
   functionality.

    Tip                                                                       
    In order to affect your system by your nix-language-specific changes you  
    have to evaluate it, run (as root):                                       
                                                                              
    # nixos-rebuild switch                                                    

    Tip                                                                       
    When starting a VM, you may run into NS_ERROR_FAILURE. If you check the   
    log you might see something like                                          
                                                                              
      00:00:00.616892 Audio: Initializing ALSA driver                         
                                                                              
    In this case, the audio driver causes a crash. This can be fixed by       
    switching to another driver such as PULSE.                                

   Warning: Ensure that you do not put virtualbox into your
   environment.systemPackages when you've enabled it with
   virtualisation.virtualbox.host.enable = true. If you put virtualbox into
   your environment.systemPackages, VirtualBox won't be able to access it's
   driver, and attempting to start a VM will fail with the error
   NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0X80004005).

VirtualBox Oracle Extensions

   Note: This package is unfree and requires extra steps to install.

   Oracle VirtualBox Extensions are required if you want to forward usb2 or
   usb3 to your guests. The Extensions are unfree.

 {
    nixpkgs.config.allowUnfree = true;
    virtualisation.virtualbox.host.enable = true;
    virtualisation.virtualbox.host.enableExtensionPack = true;
 }

    Tip                                                                       
    If USB forwarding is only advanced feature used in virtualization, then   
    consider using an open-source virtualization solution such as GNOME Boxes 
    or Virt-manager to avoid frequent recompilations..                        

   Warning: Host extensions cause frequent recompilation.

   Possible solutions:

     * Use a pinned vbox module, see how to pin:
       https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/41212
     * Also see
       https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48838411/install-virtualbox-modules-from-nixos-unstable-in-configuration-nix
     * Use module from https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/71127 (unsafe)
       if you'd like to avoid recompilation.
     * Use Virt-manager instead of VirtualBox

VirtualBox Guest Additions

 {
   virtualisation.virtualbox.guest.enable = true;
   virtualisation.virtualbox.guest.dragAndDrop = true;
 }
