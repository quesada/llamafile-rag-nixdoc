   Notes on running NixOS on the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL, WSL2)

Setup

   Ensure that WSL is installed and up to date.

 wsl --install
 wsl --update

   Sometimes you'll have to install WSL2 manually by downloading the
   msi-installation package.

   NixOS is not yet packaged as a official WSL distribution or on the
   Microsoft store. Download the latest release of nixos-wsl.tar.gz from the
   NixOS-WSL Github page.

   Import the WSL container using PowerShell

 wsl --import NixOS .\NixOS\ nixos-wsl.tar.gz --version 2

Usage

   Start it with PowerShell

 wsl -d NixOS

Tips and tricks

  Run container on startup

   To run the distro NixOS on Windows startup or user login in the
   background, proceed with following commands in PowerShell

 echo "" > $HOME\run_wsl2_at_startup.vbs
 notepad $HOME\run_wsl2_at_startup.vbs

   Inside the script we define NixOS as the distribution name, as imported in
   the setup step above

    

 $HOME\run_wsl2_at_startup.vbs

 set object = createobject("wscript.shell")
 object.run "wsl.exe --distribution NixOS", 0

   Execute following command to open the task planer

 taskschd.msc

   Click on Create task on the right pane, set name to WSL. On the tab
   "Triggers" click on "New ..." and select run task on user login in the
   dropdown menu. On the tab "Action" click on "New ..." and insert as
   command: %USERPROFILE%\run_wsl2_at_startup.vbs
