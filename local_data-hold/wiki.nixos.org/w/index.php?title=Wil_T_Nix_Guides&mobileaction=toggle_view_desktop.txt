About

   In early 2021, Wilfred Taylor (Wil T), produced a series of eight video
   guides covering the Nix ecosystem from the ground up. This page is an
   overview with information about each guide. These guides are perhaps
   currently the best available video resource for getting an early
   understanding of Nix, and will step you through getting a working NixOS
   machine.

   The series runs for a total of 3 hours and 32 minutes. It starts with a
   general overview, progresses to setting up a NixOS desktop, covers
   managing NixOS config repositories, gives a general overview of the Nix
   ecosystem and enough hands-on exploration to get oriented, and ends with
   coverage of Flakes and migration of configurations to a Flake based
   system.

   At the time of production, NixOS 20.09 was the latest release, so the
   guides are using it. Currently, i.e. on 21.05 or unstable, not much has
   changed that would impact following the guides as produced.

Guide series

   For convenience, a page with the playlist in order is available: Wil T's

  Moving NixOS System Configuration into a Flake

   Video Link Playtime: ~33 minutes

   In the last video, Wil explains how to move your NixOS system
   configuration and Home Manager configuration into a nix flake file. This
   can help you with control of which versions of packages you are pointing
   to and make it easier to manage your system changes over time. In the
   first few minutes he explains how to modify your NixOS system
   configuration in order to enable the experimental flakes feature.

   From 4:22, he does nix flake init, and begins setting up the flake file.

   From 16:08, he starts nixos-rebuild build ... after migrating basic
   configurations from the previous videos into the flake setup. Most of the
   rest of the video goes into detail about building out helper scripts and
   re-integrating setup using the flake structure.

   From 28:54, he summarizes the change and outlines examples of how flakes
   make it more logical and convenient to expand and modularize your system
   configurations going forward (e.g., by creating roles that apply to
   different types of systems).

   From 30:10, he presents his own flake-based configuration on Github.
