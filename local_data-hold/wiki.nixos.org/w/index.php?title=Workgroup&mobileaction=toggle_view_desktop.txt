   From NixOS Wiki

   Workgroups are interest groups of people working on the same topic in the
   nix* ecosystem.

   For this, we provide the namespace. To create a workgroup “Example”, just
   create the article Workgroup:Example, link it from this page, add
   [[Category:Community]] via Edit_Source and find some folks to collaborate
   with!

   Your workgroup page should probably start with description of the scope,
   followed a People section where each participant can link to their
   userpage (on which they provide contact data). Afterwards, it is up to you
   how to organize yourself. Link to tooling or issues, have a discussion
   section (where you can sign your comment with ~~~~), create a few wiki
   entries …
