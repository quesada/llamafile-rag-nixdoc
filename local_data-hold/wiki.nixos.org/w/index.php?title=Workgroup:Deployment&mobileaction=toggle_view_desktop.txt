   This is an informal gathering of people interesting in deploying Nix(OS)
   onto various targets like bare-metal, cloud, containers, … Following
   NixCon and other informal discussions there are quite a few people working
   in that area. The goal is to bring people together on the subject so that
   we don’t re-invent the wheel in our corners. It might also allow us to
   work towards bigger goals that any individual might not be able to tackle
   in his own.

   Everyone interested is welcome to join it as this is not an official team.

   For a start I propose to engage in conversation in the new “Deployment
   Working Group” category. Go to
   https://discourse.nixos.org/c/dev/deployments-working-group 13 and select
   “Tracking” to be notified of new messages in the group.
