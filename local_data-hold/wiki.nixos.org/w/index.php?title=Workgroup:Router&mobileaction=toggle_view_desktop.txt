   The router working group is various people who collaborate and share ideas
   in #networking:nixos.org on Matrix.

Work in Progress

   A couple of projekts are in development for this topic:

     * liminix - A Nix-based system for configuring consumer wifi routers or
       IoT device devices, of the kind that OpenWrt or DD-WRT or Gargoyle or
       Tomato run on.
     * NixWRT - replacing OpenWRT with the nix toolchain.
          * This project has been archived
          * NixWRT Project Update 2018-01-16
          * Musl support in nixpkgs
     * dewclaw - generate OpenWRT UCI config from Nix
     * Not-OS - an operating system generator, based on NixOS, that, given a
       config, outputs a small (47 MB), read-only squashfs for a runit-based
       operating system
