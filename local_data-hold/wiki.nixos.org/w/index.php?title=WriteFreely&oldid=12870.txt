   WriteFreely is a blogging platform with support for ActivityPub and is
   available in NixOS starting with release 22.11.

Setup

   To create your WriteFreely instance, enable the option
   services.writefreely.enable.

 {
   services.writefreely = {
     # Create a WriteFreely instance.
     enable = true;

     # Create a WriteFreely admin account.
     admin.name = "my-username";
    
     # The public host name to serve.
     host = "blog.example.com";
   };
 }

   For more specific configuration, see the following sections.

  Admin Account

   WriteFreely requires an admin account be created to access the web UI.
   This can be set using the options under services.writefreely.admin.

 {
   services.writefreely = {
     enable = true;

     admin = {
       name = "my-username";
       # If not specified, a default password of "nixos" will be used. Your password can be
       # updated using the web interface.
       initialPasswordFile = "/path/to/password.txt";
     };
   };
 }

  Database

   WriteFreely supports multiple database engines. The NixOS module lets you
   select which you would like to use and enables easy provisioning of local
   databases. See the options under services.writefreely.database.

    SQLite

   The default database is SQLite. This can be configured with the following
   options.

 {
   services.writefreely = {
     enable = true;

     database = {
       # This is the default database type.
       type = "sqlite3";

       # This is the file name of the SQLite database, relative to the
       # stateDir (default: /var/lib/writefreely).
       filename = "writefreely.db";

       # The name of the database to create in SQLite.
       database = "writefreely";
     };
   };
 }

    MySQL

   You can choose to use a MySQL database instead of SQLite.

   Note: WriteFreely requires a database password to be configured. See
   writefreely/writefreely#568 for details.

      Local MySQL

   To create a local MySQL database, see the following example.

 {
   services.writefreely = {
     enable = true;

     database = {
       # Use the MySQL database engine.
       type = "mysql";

       # Run MySQL locally.
       createLocally = true;

       # Set a password for the database so WriteFreely can access it.
       passwordFile = "/path/to/password.txt";
     };
   };
 }

      Remote MySQL

   To use a remote MySQL database, see the following example.

 {
   services.writefreely = {
     enable = true;

     database = {
       # Use the MySQL database engine.
       type = "mysql";

       # The name of the database to store data in.
       name = "writefreely";
       # The database user to connect as.
       user = "writefreely";
       # The database host to connect to.
       host = "10.0.0.1";
       # The port to connect to the database on.
       port = 3306;

       # Set a password for the database so WriteFreely can access it.
       passwordFile = "/path/to/password.txt";
     };
   };
 }

  Nginx

   Nginx can be used as a reverse proxy for your WriteFreely instance. This
   can be configured with the options under services.writefreely.nginx.

 {
   services.writefreely = {
     enable = true;

     nginx = {
       # Enable Nginx and configure it to serve WriteFreely.
       enable = true;

       # You can force users to connect with HTTPS.
       forceSSL = true;
     };
   };
 }

  ACME

   Automatic SSL certificates can be retrieved using ACME. When used with
   Nginx, the certificates will be managed by NixOS's default ACME
   configuration. When not using Nginx, WriteFreely will manage certificates
   itself.

 {
   services.writefreely = {
     enable = true;

     acme = {
       # Automatically fetch and configure SSL certs.
       enable = true;
     };
   };
 }

  Settings

   Settings for WriteFreely's configuration file config.ini can be set using
   the option services.writefreely.settings. See the WriteFreely
   documentation for a list of settings.

 {
   services.writefreely = {
     enable = true;

     settings = {
       server = {
         port = 8080;
       };
     };
   };
 }
