HiDPI

   HiDPI (High Dots Per Inch) displays, also known by Apple's "Retina
   Display" marketing name, are screens with a high resolution in a
   relatively small format. They are mostly found in high-end laptops and
   monitors.

   Not all software behaves well in high-resolution mode yet. Here are listed
   most common tweaks which make work on a HiDPI screen more pleasant:

   # bigger tty fonts
   console.font =
     "${pkgs.terminus_font}/share/consolefonts/ter-u28n.psf.gz";
   services.xserver.dpi = 180;
   environment.variables = {
     ## Used by GTK 3
     # `GDK_SCALE` is limited to integer values
     GDK_SCALE = "2";
     # Inverse of GDK_SCALE
     GDK_DPI_SCALE = "0.5";

     # Used by Qt 5
     QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR = "1";

     _JAVA_OPTIONS = "-Dsun.java2d.uiScale=2";
   };
   # Expose variables to graphical systemd user services
   services.xserver.displayManager.importedVariables = [
     "GDK_SCALE"
     "GDK_DPI_SCALE"
     "QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR"
   ];

   To enable HiDPI scaling for Qt 6 applications, add the following to
   .Xresources:

 Xft.dpi: 180

Disabling touchpad and mouse accelerations

   To disable touchpad and mouse accelerations just add the following lines
   to your configuration.nix

   services.xserver = {
     enable = true;

     ...

     libinput = {
       enable = true;

       # disabling mouse acceleration
       mouse = {
         accelProfile = "flat";
       };

       # disabling touchpad acceleration
       touchpad = {
         accelProfile = "flat";
       };
     };

     ...

   };

   To get more information see man configuration.nix.

Exclude packages

   Some packages like xterm are included when enabling Xorg. To exclude
   packages, edit the configuration.nix as the example, but be sure to have
   another terminal enabled in your build before doing this.

 services.xserver.excludePackages = with pkgs; [
   xterm
 ];
