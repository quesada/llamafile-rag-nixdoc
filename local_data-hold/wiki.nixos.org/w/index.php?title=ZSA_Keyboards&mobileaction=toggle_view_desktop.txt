   From NixOS Wiki

   ZSA offers a variety of ergonomic keyboards, such as the Ergodox EZ and
   the Moonlander Mark I.

   The use of ZSA's keyboards does not require any change to the NixOS
   configuration, but flashing firmware onto them does.

                             Configuring a keyboard

   ZSA's keyboards can be configured using their online Oryx configurator
   tool. You will then need to flash the firmware onto the keyboard, which
   can be done in three ways, all necessitating a common change in the NixOS
   configuration, as seen in the following section.

                               Flashing firmware

Pre-requirement

   Some udev rules are necessary for the connection before flashing any
   firmware onto the keyboard. You have to activate them in your NixOS
   configuration first:

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 hardware.keyboard.zsa.enable = true;

   Once the new configuration is applied, you may flash ZSA's keyboards with
   one of the three following methods.

Flashing via a Chromium-based web browser (Chrome, Chromium...)

   In ZSA's Oryx configurator tool, you can click “Save to my keyboard” to
   flash the keyboard.

Flashing via wally-cli (command line tool)

   ZSA's wally-cli command-line tool can be used to flash the keyboard. You
   will need to install it:

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ wally-cli ];

   Then, you may use the following command to flash the keyboard, replacing
   the path with the location of the downloaded firmware:

 wally-cli /path/to/firmware.bin

Flashing via Keymapp (graphical tool)

   ZSA's keymapp graphical tool can be used to flash the keyboard. It is
   user-friendly, and has other features, such as live layout viewing, key
   presses heatmap, and links to various tools offered by ZSA's online Oryx
   configurator. You will need to install it:

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ keymapp ];
