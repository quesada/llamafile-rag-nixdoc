    This article or section needs expansion.

   Zim is a desktop note-taking application.

Installation

   Zim can be installed from the zim package.

Plugins

   Zim bundles many plugins by default.

  Installing unbundled plugins

   Plugins not included with Zim can be installed into
   ~/.local/share/zim/plugins.

   For example, here is how you would install the zim-auto-linker plugin with
   Home Manager:

 { pkgs, ... }:
 {
   xdg.dataDir."zim/plugins/zim-auto-linker".source = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
     owner = "auralluring";
     repo = "zim-auto-linker";
     rev = "abcdefg1234"; # FIXME: replace with actual value
     hash = pkgs.lib.fakeHash; # FIXME: replace with actual value
   };
 }
