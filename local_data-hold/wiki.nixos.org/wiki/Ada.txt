   From NixOS Wiki

   Ada is a programming language.

Building programs

  GNAT

   The GNAT Ada toolchain is fully packaged in Nixpkgs and can be used to
   build software. It has a bit less convenience than typical C/C++
   toolchains due to its small user base. A simple Ada program using GPR can
   be built as follows:

 { stdenv, gnat, gprbuild, glibc }:

 stdenv.mkDerivation {
   pname = "an-ada-program";
   version = "1.2.3";

   src = ...;

   nativeBuildInputs = [
     gprbuild
     gnat
   ];

   dontConfigure = true;

   buildPhase = ''
     runHook preBuild

     gprbuild

     runHook postBuild
   '';

   installPhase = ''
     runHook preInstall

     mkdir -p $out/bin

     # Only install what we need to run the binary.
     gprinstall --prefix=$out hello.gpr \
       --no-project \
       --no-manifest \
       --mode=usage

     runHook postInstall
   '';
 }

    Building static binaries

   If you try to build static binaries, you need to add the static version of
   libc manually. For this, add glibc to the derivation parameters (at the
   top) and add the following to the derivation itself.

   buildInputs = [
     glibc.static
   ];

   There is an example on GitHub.
