   From NixOS Wiki

   Ambermoon is a role-playing game developed and published by Thalion
   Software, released in 1993 for the Amiga. It was the second part of an
   unfinished trilogy (Amberstar, released in 1992, being the first). It is
   considered to be one of the best RPGs for this platform.

   Its possible to run the original Ambermoon with an emulator for the Amiga
   computers (possible via Amiga Emulator Core in RetroArch).

Ambermoon.net

   Ambermoon.net is an open source rewrite for Windows, Linux and Mac. Its
   available with two flavours:

     * Ambermoon.net: with modern enhancement but almost the same gameplay
     * Ambermoon.net Advanced: With some improvements and changes to gameplay
       and content.

   Ambermoon.net is stable, but also still in active development.

   You do not need the orginal Ambermoon game files to run Ambermoon.net.

Install and run game

   There is no nixpkgs yet, manually running it or running the Lutris version
   will not work on NixOS due to the needed libraries. A very easy way to run
   it is via steam-run.

     * Install the steam-run commandline tool: just add the package to your
       NixOS configuration and rebuild:

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ steam-run ];

     * Download the latest release from:
       https://github.com/Pyrdacor/Ambermoon.net
     * Extract it in some directory
     * use a terminal and execute in this directory

 steam-run Ambermoon.net

Install modifications

   The game itself has an optional auto-updater and you can choose, whether
   you want to run Ambermoon.net or Ambermoon.net Advance.
