   From NixOS Wiki

   By default as of NixOS 21.05, apropos, whatis and man -k do not find
   anything when run, because the man page index cache is not generated.

   To generate it manually (and again to update it when new software is
   installed), run:

 sudo mkdir -p /var/cache/man/nixos
 sudo mandb

   To enable automatically building the immutable cache, you can set:

 documentation.man.generateCaches = true;

   Note that this will rebuild the cache every time you change anything in
   environment.systemPackages, and will make the mandb command fail.
