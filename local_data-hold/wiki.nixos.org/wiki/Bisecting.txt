   From NixOS Wiki

   Bisecting is a feature of version control systems such as Git and
   Mercurial to easily pinpoint regressions. Owing to their reproducibility,
   Nix and NixOS are well-suited to this. As a result, we will list a few
   tips for using tools like this in the Nix context.

Commit selection

   There are different ways to tweak git bisect's commit selection to reduce
   the required builds:

     * git bisect start flag --first-parent: select merge commits, which
       depending on the repository can help for caching as well as commit
       stability.
     * hydrasect: select cached commits cached by Hydra - broken
     * nixpkgs-staging-bisecter (nix-build only): reduce number of
       derivations to be built.

Automating bisects

     * git bisect run: runs the selected command until the culprit is found.
     * nix-bisect: helps better judge outcome (git bisect's good vs bad skip)
       and gives nicer outputs than git bisect run.

Flakes

   Bisecting changes in a flake itself can just follow the regular bisecting
   process. Bisecting regressions in flakes' inputs is a bit different in the
   sense the repositories you are building is not the repository you are
   bisecting. In this case you can use:

     * --override-input: nix flag that enables bisecting flakes' inputs
     * --flake flag on nix operations: allows overriding flake directory so
       you can use nix flake operations from e.g. git bisect run
