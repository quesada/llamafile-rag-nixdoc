   From NixOS Wiki

   Nix's reproducibility allows for easy building of ancient nixpkgs
   checkouts.

   An attempt to get firefox 2.0 running can be found here:
   https://github.com/ckiee/nixpkgs/commits/2007-fixing

Replacing outdated nix.cs.uu.nl

   You may find that the build fails as it cannot find some tarballs. This is
   solved by updating the primary mirror URL to one that is still running:

 for x in $(find); do sed -i 's/nix.cs.uu.nl/tarballs.nixos.org/g' "$x"; done
 for x in $(find); do sed -i 's/dist\/tarballs\///g' "$x"; done

   You will also want to run nix-build with the --no-substitute flag to avoid
   any outdated caches.

Replacing outdated package sources

   nix-build may fail while trying to fetch a package from a 3rd-party
   mirror. If this happens, you will need to search the internet for another
   mirror from which you can fetch the package; for certain nixpkgs versions
   you will need to ensure it does not force-redirect to SSL as curl was not
   built with SSL support in early versions.

   You can manually add a tarball to the store by using nix-prefetch-url. You
   have to use the same checksum algorithm used in the nixpkgs definition
   with the --type parameter.
