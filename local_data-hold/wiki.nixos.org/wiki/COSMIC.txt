   From NixOS Wiki

   COSMIC is a desktop environment developed in the Rust programming
   language, using the iced cross platform GUI library for Rust, and Smithay
   as building blocks for its compositor, cosmic-comp. Cosmic-comp is
   comparable to smithay's own anvil compositor demonstration, just like the
   Wayland project uses Weston as demo compositor.

   COSMIC was primarily developed for use in the Pop!_OS distribution.

In Progress

   COSMIC support in nixpkgs is still in development. You can follow progress
   via the tracking issue.

   There is a flake to setup COSMIC on NixOS.

COSMIC Packages

   While the whole desktop is not configured many packages are available in
   nixpkgs already. You can search for packages with a query similar to this
   one
   https://search.nixos.org/packages?query=cosmic&from=0&size=1000&sort=relevance&channel=unstable.
   Note that not all of the results will be part of the COSMIC desktop.
