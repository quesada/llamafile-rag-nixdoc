   From NixOS Wiki

   Calibre is program to view, edit, convert and print ebooks.

   This page is intended to explain how to run calibre in nixos.

.cbr and .cbz files

   If you want to open .cbr and .cbz files, you need to add the following
   lines to your configuration.nix file:

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [     
   (calibre.override {
     unrarSupport = true;
   })
 ]

   Note: calibre requires several unfree packages to open .cbr and .cbz
   files. If you are using allowUnfreePredicate you will need to ensure that
   your configurations permit all of them.

 {
   nixpkgs.config.allowUnfreePredicate = pkg: builtins.elem (lib.getName pkg) [
     "calibre"
     "unrar"
   ];
 }
