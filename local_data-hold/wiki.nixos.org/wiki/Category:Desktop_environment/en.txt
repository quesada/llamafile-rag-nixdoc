   Linux desktop environments are graphical user interfaces and sets of tools
   for a PC. They allow you to manage windows, edit settings, and much more,
   as well as offering different sets of features and user experiences.

   Contrary to most other Linux distributions, it is trivial to install and
   change desktop environments in NixOS. For example, the use of a fully
   functional GNOME desktop environment only requires the following lines in
   your configuration.

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.xserver.enable = true;
 services.xserver.displayManager.gdm.enable = true;
 services.xserver.desktopManager.gnome.enable = true;

   Changing the desktopManager and displayManager options should be enough to
   select a different desktop environment. Applying the configuration and
   rebooting the system should greet you to your new environment. Only some
   desktop environments require additional configuration options. Because of
   how NixOS works, the system will not become bloated when experimenting
   with different desktop environments by their various tools and
   dependencies: The default applications of a desktop environment are only
   here when said desktop environment is active, or when you manually install
   programs from another desktop environment.
