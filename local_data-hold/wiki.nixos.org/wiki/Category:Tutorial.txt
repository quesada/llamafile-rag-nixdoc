   From NixOS Wiki

   Tutorial is one of the five primary resource categories for the wiki.

   Tutorials are lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of
   steps to complete a project of some kind. They are what your project needs
   in order to show a beginner that they can achieve something with it.

   They are wholly learning-oriented, and specifically, they are oriented
   towards learning how rather than learning that.

Writing a tutorial

   You are the teacher, and you are responsible for what the student will do.
   Under your instruction, the student will execute a series of actions to
   achieve some end.

   The end and the actions are up to you, but deciding what they should be
   can be hard work. The end has to be meaningful, but also achievable for a
   complete beginner.

   Consider an analogy of teaching a child to cook.

   What you teach the child to cook isn’t really important. What’s important
   is that the child finds it enjoyable, and gains confidence, and wants to
   do it again.

   Through the things the child does, it will learn important things about
   cooking. It will learn what it is like to be in the kitchen, to use the
   utensils, to handle the food.

   This is because using software, like cooking, is a matter of craft. It’s
   knowledge - but it is practical knowledge, not theoretical knowledge. When
   we learn a new craft or skill, we always begin learning it by doing.

   The important thing is that having done the tutorial, the learner is in a
   position to make sense of the rest of the documentation, and the software
   itself.

Comparison to other resource page types

     * If information is more encyclopedic (with a similar scope and tone to
       pages on Wikipedia), a page would be considered a pedia.
     * If information is less encyclopedic and more similar to a compendium,
       study guide, or a bibliographic guide, a page would be considered a
       guide.
     * If information is more about direct instruction to achieve a specific
       task, a page would be considered a tutorial.
     * If a page is more just a set of tips and tricks (less instructive than
       a tutorial), it would be a cookbook.
     * If a page is a detailed reference (like a man page or full software
       manual), it would fit under references.
