   Chroot is an operation that changes the apparent root directory for the
   current running process and their children. A program that is run in such
   a modified environment cannot access files and commands outside that
   environmental directory tree. This modified environment is called a chroot
   jail.

                               Using nixos-enter

   nixos-enter allows to access a NixOS installation from a NixOS rescue
   system.

   The nixos-enter program is part of NixOS. Before it runs provides a shell,
   the script mounts api filesystems like /proc and setups the profile and
   /etc of the target system. To use it, setup /mnt as described in the
   installation manual.

   At the time of writting, the following mount commands should suffice:

 $ mount -o bind /dev/disk/by-label/<ROOT_LABEL> /mnt/
 $ # mount any partitions you might have; here we assume only home and nix exist
 $ mkdir -p /mnt/{home,nix}
 $ mount -o bind /dev/disk/by-label/<HOME_LABEL> /mnt/home
 $ mount -o bind /dev/disk/by-label/<NIX_LABEL> /mnt/nix

   Then run nixos-enter:

 $ nixos-enter

   Note, that when using nixos-rebuild inside the environment provided by
   nixos-enter, you have to give nixos-rebuild subcommands the --option
   sandbox false option, otherwise derivation builds will fail with the
   following error:

 error: cloning builder process: Operation not permitted
 error: unable to start build process

                                 Manual chroot

   If a NixOS rescue system is not available, the chroot can be done manually
   from another Linux distribution.

   Mount the file system containing the NixOS to chroot into at /mnt, using
   e.g.:

 mount /dev/relevantPartitionNameHere /mnt

   .

   Mount the host system's Linux run-time api file systems inside the mount,
   then populate /run using the activate script and chroot inside, starting a
   bash shell (adapted from here; you may copy all these lines into your
   terminal as one block to run them):

 mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev
 mount -o bind /proc /mnt/proc
 mount -o bind /sys /mnt/sys
 chroot /mnt /nix/var/nix/profiles/system/activate
 chroot /mnt /run/current-system/sw/bin/bash

   You should now be in your NixOS system, and should be able to adjust it by
   e.g. editing /etc/nixos/configuration.nix and running nixos-rebuild switch
   as usual. Remember that you may have to establish Internet access within
   the chroot for some commands.

                                Troubleshooting

1. nixos-rebuild fails with "System has not been booted with <program> as init
system."

   In some cases, such as when using systemd-networkd as the bootloader,
   nixos-rebuild commands might fail with a message similar to

 error: System has not been booted with systemd as init system (PID 1). Can't operate.

   If you have tried to use nixos-rebuild switch, you can try nixos-rebuild
   boot instead. Should that also fail, you can append
   NIXOS_SWITCH_USE_DIRTY_ENV=1 to the commands, which should bypass the
   error while also setting the proper boot entries, if the bootloader is
   detected.

   Finally, should all else fail, nixos-install should work as a replacement
   changing the root.
