   (Redirected from Create and debug nix packages)

   This article describes how to work with the nix related repositories to
   add new packages, edit and debug existing packages. For details on the
   NixOS module system see NixOS:Modules. NixOS:extend_NixOS explains how to
   write, test and debug your own modules.

   There is a chapter about hacking packages and modules in the NixOS manual:
   development

   Writing packages is covered in quick start and writing modules is covered
   in the manual

   If you've read the manual and still don't know how to go about creating a
   package, read on.

   The nix repositories are hosted at https://github.com/NixOS

Basics

   The code for nix packages is managed in the nixpkgs/pkgs repository. NixOS
   services, and other system configuration options are managed in
   nixpkgs/nixos.

   The steps to take for your first change should look something like this:

    1. Fork the repo (e.g. click the fork button on
       https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs).
    2. Clone your fork git clone --depth 1
       https://github.com/YOURNAME/nixpkgs.git
    3. Hack hack hack
    4. Push your changes to your fork
    5. Open a pull request
    6. Profit!

   This is pretty much the standard way to use github, so if you have trouble
   using git or github any general guide on these should get you going, or
   just ask on the NixOS IRC channel. The rest of this guide deals with the
   "Hack hack hack" step :)

Rough process for creating a package

   There are different steps here depending on whether you're building from
   source or packaging an existing binary. There are some common steps too.

  Package from source code

    1. Read the repo build instructions and CI scripts (for example, on
       GitHub, these are located in .github/workflows).
    2. Look in nixpkgs for a package with a similar build process to use as
       reference. For example, if you're packaging a project written in Go,
       find a package for an existing Go application. Each language has its
       own supporting Nix functions and a more or less standard way of
       dealing with things. For example, Go has buildGoModule. Rust has
       buildRustPackage. Python has buildPythonApplication. Node.js has
       node2nix, yarn2nix, etc. There are also specific functions for
       wrapping e.g. GNOME applications (wrapGAppsHook), or Qt apps
       (libsForQt5, wrapQtAppsHook). Refer to the language support chapter in
       the nixpkgs manual.
    3. If there isn't a specific builder for the language, use
       stdenv.mkDerivation directly, which has built-in support for GNU make
       (and other build systems, provided you add the necessary
       nativeBuildInputs).
    4. Figure out at least some dependencies from the project repo. See if
       they're available in nixpkgs (nix search some-library or nix-locate
       --top-level lib/somelibrary.so). If any dependency is missing you'll
       need to package that as well.
    5. Create your derivation in default.nix in some empty local directory.
    6. At the top of the derivation, temporarily add with import <nixpkgs>
       {};. For now, don't worry too much about declaring every dependency as
       a parameter, to save time.
    7. Build the package with nix-build. Iterate on tweaking the derivation
       and rebuilding until it succeeds.
    8. For large projects with long compile times, you can use nix-shell
       instead to run the individual phases.
    9. At this stage, you may encounter some build quirks of the project.
       Compile-time errors will hopefully explain what you're missing. For
       example micromamba needs a specialized build of libsolv.
   10. Read on below for further steps.

  Packages from binaries

    1. There's probably a package for it for some other distro. Use that
       package definition to figure out the dependencies. For example, if you
       have a deb package you can view its dependencies by running dpkg -I
       <package.deb>. Arch packages can also be useful to look up for
       reference (view the package's PKGBUILD):
    2. Sometimes the definitions for other distros won't be enough by nix's
       standards. If that's the case, use ldd and/or strace to find the rest
       of the dependencies. If you're not familiar with ldd/strace see How to
       find out the dynamic libraries executables loads when run?
    3. See how other nix binary packages deal with dependencies. For example
       nix packages based on deb packages.
    4. If the application contains some helper executable or vendored
       dlopen'd library you will probably need to give the nix treatment to
       it as well. For example, JetBrains Rider vendors dotnet so it needs to
       be replaced with the dotnet nix package.
    5. Because there's no real build step here you'll have to rely more on
       testing the actual execution of the package.

  Both source code packages and binary packages

    1. Once you have the package building successfully, test the output.
       Ensure the build completes usingnix-build, then run
       result/bin/<executableName>. Test as much functionality of the
       application as you can to ensure that it works as intended.
    2. Now that your package builds and runs, it's time to move it to
       nixpkgs. Read nixpkgs/CONTRIBUTING.md, make sure your package is up to
       the standards e.g. add a suitable meta section.
    3. Git clone https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs, figure out the best
       category / directory for the application (within
       https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tree/master/pkgs/), create the
       directory for your application, and move your default.nix there.
    4. If you used with import <nixpkgs> {}; to iterate more quickly, now is
       the time to replace that with the actual dependencies as an attribute
       set at the beginning of the file e.g. { lib, stdenv, fetchFromGitHub
       }:
    5. Add the package to the top level declaration of packages. Most of the
       time this will be
       https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix
       .
    6. If this is your first package in nixpkgs, add yourself in
       https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/maintainers/maintainer-list.nix
       in a separate commit.
    7. Read on about the final steps of branching and sending your PR in
       https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md .

How to install from the local repository

   For expediency just for this article, we'll shallow clone direct from the
   distribution repo and set an environment variable pointing to it.

 $ mkdir -p ~/tmpdev && cd ~/tmpdev
 $ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs
 $ export NIXPKGS=~/tmpdev/nixpkgs
 $ ls $NIXPKGS

   make some changes ...

   example: list all available software from the local repository $NIXPKGS

 $ nix-env -f $NIXPKGS -qaP '*'

   example: update the system based on your local $NIXPKGS

 $ nixos-rebuild -I nixpkgs=$NIXPKGS switch

   example: build an expression and put the output in to `pwd`/results

 $ nix-build $NIXPKGS -A irssi

   example: get an environment which is used to build irssi (also see
   nix-shell)

 $ nix-build $NIXPKGS --run-env -A irssi

   example: get a persistent environment which is used to build irssi

 $ nix-build $NIXPKGS --run-env -A irssi --add-root

Tracking upstream changes and avoiding extra rebuilding

   You have forked the relevant nix repository, but you will want to track
   changes in the upstream nix repo too. You can add a remote, and a
   corresponding branch for this.

 $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git

   You can create a branch to track the upstream master branch:

 $ git fetch upstream
 $ git checkout -b upstream-master upstream/master
 $ git pull

   This will put you into a branch with all the latest changes. Hydra, the
   build farm, regularly creates binaries, but, since people are constantly
   contributing to the nix repositories, it is usually the case that there
   are changes in the master branch which have not yet made it into the
   binary channel. To take advantage of available binaries you can switch to
   the revision which produced the binaries in your current system and apply
   your changes from there. You can use `nixos-version` to see the relevant
   short revision hash:

 $ nixos-version
 14.11pre52727.5d97886 (Caterpillar)
 ${NixOS release}.${nixpkgs revision}
 (since the git-repo called nixos was merged into nixpkgs)

 $ nixos-version
 13.07pre4871_18de9f6-3c35dae (Aardvark)
 ${NixOS release}_${NixOS revision}-${nixpkgs revision}

   This string shows the Nixos release number (13.07pre4871) followed by the
   nixos revision used to produce your current system (18de9f6) followed by
   the nixpkgs revision (3c35dae).

 $ git branch
 upstream-master
 $ git checkout -b nixpkgs-channel 3c35dae
 Switched to a new branch 'nixpkgs-channel'
 $ git checkout -b my-new-pkg
 Switched to a new branch 'my-new-pkg'

   After making some changes you can commit them into your local repo:

 $ git add foo
 $ git commit

   Then you push your changes to your fork:

 $ git push origin my-new-pkg

   You can use this to open a pull request on github.

   If some time has passed since you have created your fork, you will want to
   merge your changes with upstream and test that it still works.

 $ git fetch upstream
 $ git merge upstream

   If your merge then fails because someone else has made the same change
   (for example, someone else also packaged a library you have just packed
   for the program you want to get into nixpkgs), then you can do this:

 $ git rebase -i HEAD~10

   there select the edit mode for your commit and remove the your code which
   added the library. **Warning: only use 'git rebase' on your commits, which
   have not been pushed and nobody else is working with already!**

   Next you have to test if your program works with the library packaged from
   someone else, then do:

 $ git checkout master
 $ git log --stat

   and pick the commit where the library was added. Finally cherry-pick that
   commit into your branch:

 $ git checkout my-new-pkg
 $ git cherry-pick 5d97886a6a545fb20495e0837cc50fa63d2a80e1

   Afterwards do your usual tests and if needed also make modifications to
   the library but keep in mind that this might break the other use-case of
   that library and if in doubt check that as well.

Using nix-shell for package development

   nix-shell is a command which drops you into the build environment for a
   package. This is convenient for writing and debugging nix expressions.
   Nix-shell requires nix-1.6.x although running nix-build --run-env produces
   a similar environment.

 $ mkdir -p ~/tmpdev/bc-build  &&  cd ~/tmpdev/bc-build
 $ nix-shell $NIXPKGS -A bc

   You can also drop in the build environment for a package not in nixpkgs.

 $ mkdir -p ~/tmpdev/bc-build  &&  cd ~/tmpdev/bc-build
 $ nix-shell -E "with import <nixpkgs> {}; callPackage /path/to/package.nix {}"

   You would have seen the dependencies downloading, but the bc-build
   directory remains empty. The build system would next invoke a builder with
   some arguments. You can obtain the exact name of the builder (usually
   bash) and the arguments args of the builder (typically a shell script) by
   checking the corresponding value in:

 $ nix derivation show $(nix-instantiate .)

   However, most of the time (for instance when using stdenv ) the default
   builder invokes first source $stdenv/setup to load the appropriate
   environment variables, and then genericBuild(). This is a shell function
   defined by stdenv that you can review like this...

 $ typeset -f genericBuild | less

   which shows when custom variables $buildCommandPath or $buildCommand are
   defined, those are evaluated exclusively. Otherwise, if no custom $phases
   variable is set, the standard build phase order is used as shown here...

 $ typeset -f genericBuild | grep 'phases='
 phases="$prePhases unpackPhase patchPhase $preConfigurePhases configurePhase $preBuildPhases buildPhase checkPhase $preInstallPhases installPhase fixupPhase installCheckPhase $preDistPhases distPhase $postPhases";

   The phases can be defined either as a string to be eval'ed or as a shell
   function, this is how Nix invokes it.

   So to observe a full build, you can do...

 $ export out=~/tmpdev/bc-build/out
 $ set -x # Optional: it prints all commands, can be practical to debug
 $ set +e # Optional: do not quit the shell on simple errors, Ctrl-C,...
 $ export NIX_ENFORCE_PURITY=0 # Optional: nix automatically skip absolute files not in /nix/, /tmp or NIX_BUILD_TOP. When building in a nix-shell this may be an issue as the source won't be  in the above folders and you may get errors like Fatal error: blabla.h: No such file or directory. https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/204036
 $ genericBuild

   To only run some specific phases, use runPhase:

 # Syntax: runPhase *phase*
 $ runPhase unpackPhase

   While developing your own package, you need to run these phases in order:

 unpackPhase
 patchPhase
 configurePhase
 buildPhase
 checkPhase
 installPhase
 fixupPhase
 installCheckPhase
 distPhase

   Phases can be both bash functions, or environment of identical name (when
   they are overridden). genericBuild takes care of that distinction for you,
   invoking them appropriately. You can of course drop down to evaluating
   them yourself, for example to invoke an overridden phase (an environment
   variable) using eval instead:

 eval "$checkPhase"
 # etc..

   Note: you do not need to run $preConfigurePhase explicitly as it is run,
   when running configurePhase already.

   To list all functions which are declared in set:

 typeset -F
 declare -f addCVars
 declare -f addToCrossEnv
 declare -f addToNativeEnv
 declare -f addToSearchPath
 declare -f addToSearchPathWithCustomDelimiter
 declare -f buildPhase
 declare -f checkPhase
 declare -f closeNest
 declare -f command_not_found_handle
 declare -f configurePhase
 declare -f distPhase
 declare -f dumpVars
 declare -f ensureDir
 declare -f exitHandler
 declare -f findInputs
 declare -f fixLibtool
 declare -f fixupPhase
 declare -f genericBuild
 declare -f header
 declare -f installBin
 declare -f installCheckPhase
 declare -f installPhase
 declare -f patchELF
 declare -f patchPhase
 declare -f patchShebangs
 declare -f runHook
 declare -f showPhaseHeader
 declare -f startNest
 declare -f stopNest
 declare -f stripDirs
 declare -f stripHash
 declare -f substitute
 declare -f substituteAll
 declare -f substituteAllInPlace
 declare -f substituteInPlace
 declare -f unpackFile
 declare -f unpackPhase

   If the phase has been defined as a function, to list a particular function
   type:

 typeset -f unpackPhase

   Otherwise, if it was a string, simply echo the variable related to it

 echo "$unpackPhase"

   In either case, you can see the code that is about to be executed for each
   phase:

 typeset -f unpackPhase
 unpackPhase ()
 {
     runHook preUnpack;
     if [ -z "$srcs" ]; then
         if [ -z "$src" ]; then
             echo 'variable $src or $srcs should point to the source';
             exit 1;
         fi;
         srcs="$src";
     fi;
     local dirsBefore="";
     for i in *;
     do
         if [ -d "$i" ]; then
             dirsBefore="$dirsBefore $i ";
         fi;
     done;
     for i in $srcs;
     do
         unpackFile $i;
     done;
     if [ -n "$setSourceRoot" ]; then
         runHook setSourceRoot;
     else
         if [ -z "$sourceRoot" ]; then
             sourceRoot=;
             for i in *;
             do
                 if [ -d "$i" ]; then
                     case $dirsBefore in
                         *\ $i\ *)

                         ;;
                         *)
                             if [ -n "$sourceRoot" ]; then
                                 echo "unpacker produced multiple directories";
                                 exit 1;
                             fi;
                             sourceRoot="$i"
                         ;;
                     esac;
                 fi;
             done;
         fi;
     fi;
     if [ -z "$sourceRoot" ]; then
         echo "unpacker appears to have produced no directories";
         exit 1;
     fi;
     echo "source root is $sourceRoot";
     if [ "$dontMakeSourcesWritable" != 1 ]; then
         chmod -R u+w "$sourceRoot";
     fi;
     runHook postUnpack
 }

   you can also modify the configureFlags prefix:

 export configureFlags="--prefix=$out --with-readline"

   Tip: A git repository can be used for snapshotting attempts at building
   the package. This also makes it easy to generate patches, should you need
   to.

Adding custom libraries and dependencies to a package

   If you are packaging a dependency, such as a library used by applications
   for them to compile their code, you might have found you'd like to test if
   the derivation file installs correctly and can be used by other software.

   In order to do this, you'll need to make a simple program that references
   the library, make a derivation for this program, then add the dependency.
   For example:

   Your program to test the library:

 { pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:
 with pkgs;
 let yourLibraryName = callPackage /path/to/library/derivation.nix {};
 in
 stdenv.mkDerivation {
   nativeBuildInputs = [
     yourLibraryName /* Add here if needed at build time */
     /* Add other dependencies if needed */
   ]
   buildInputs = [
     yourLibraryName /* Add here if needed at runtime */
     /* Add other dependencies if needed */
   ]
   /* Add the other stuff as needed */
 }

nix channels

   nix channels can be used in parallel with your new local repositories, see
   its nix-channel-documentation

Testing Package Updates with nixpkgs-review

   You can also use nixpkgs-review to compile, review and merge packages and
   its dependencies. It claims to be faster than nox and provides a nix-shell
   where you can test the package.

   First make sure it is available in your shell:

 nix-shell -p nixpkgs-review

   You can run nixpkgs-review against uncommitted/staged changes in a cloned
   nixpkgs repository:

 cd ~/git/nixpkgs
 nixpkgs-review wip [--staged]

   It is also possible to review a specified commit:

 cd ~/git/nixpkgs
 nixpkgs-review rev HEAD

   If you have already committed your changes and created a pull request, you
   can use the pr command:

 cd ~/git/nixpkgs
 nixpkgs-review pr 5341

   You can post the build result, approve/merge or read the comments of a
   pull request inside the provided nix-shell:

 # inside the provided shell
 nixpkgs-review post-result
 nixpkgs-review approve
 nixpkgs-review merge
 nixpkgs-review comments

   If the pr provides a new package you can start it inside the nix-shell
   using its package name:

 # inside the provided shell
 packagename

Formatting Packages with nixfmt

   It is "good practice" to format packages in a way that following changed
   will create as minimal diffs as possible. The formatter nixfmt can be used
   for that.

 nix-shell -p nixfmt-rfc-style --run 'nixfmt path/to/default.nix'

Testing Packages with nixpkgs-hammering

   You can test some "good practices" in a package with nixpkgs-hammering.
   But before applying the recommendations you should read the given
   explanations.

 cd ~/git/nixpkgs
 nix run -f https://github.com/jtojnar/nixpkgs-hammering/archive/master.tar.gz -c nixpkgs-hammer packagename # if you are using stable nix
 nix run github:jtojnar/nixpkgs-hammering packagename # if you are using nix flake
