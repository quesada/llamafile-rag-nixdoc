   From NixOS Wiki

   Cypress is a frontend testing framework for web applications.

NixOS

   You cannot use Cypress directly with npm while running on NixOS.^[1] You
   can either run it with steam-run or use the cypress package.

   For example, put this shell.nix in the directory with your Cypress tests:

 { pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:
   pkgs.mkShell {
     packages = with pkgs; [
       nodejs
       cypress
     ];
 }

   You can then run nix-shell --run "Cypress" to open the Cypress UI and
   select your project.
