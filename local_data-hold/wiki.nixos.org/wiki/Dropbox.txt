Using the package

   Install the dropbox package after enabling unfree software. Then start the
   dropbox command, which will download the real dropbox binary and start it.

Configure Dropbox as a Service on NixOS

   As of right now (19 Jun 2022) there is no dropbox module in nixpkgs,
   however peterhoeg at discourse.nixos.org shared the service code he is
   using:

 {
   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     # dropbox - we don't need this in the environment. systemd unit pulls it in
     dropbox-cli
   ];

   networking.firewall = {
     allowedTCPPorts = [ 17500 ];
     allowedUDPPorts = [ 17500 ];
   };

   systemd.user.services.dropbox = {
     description = "Dropbox";
     wantedBy = [ "graphical-session.target" ];
     environment = {
       QT_PLUGIN_PATH = "/run/current-system/sw/" + pkgs.qt5.qtbase.qtPluginPrefix;
       QML2_IMPORT_PATH = "/run/current-system/sw/" + pkgs.qt5.qtbase.qtQmlPrefix;
     };
     serviceConfig = {
       ExecStart = "${lib.getBin pkgs.dropbox}/bin/dropbox";
       ExecReload = "${lib.getBin pkgs.coreutils}/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID";
       KillMode = "control-group"; # upstream recommends process
       Restart = "on-failure";
       PrivateTmp = true;
       ProtectSystem = "full";
       Nice = 10;
     };
   };
 }

   A pull request has been created to add Dropbox as a Nixos module which
   builds on this code snippet (21 Apr 2020). As of 19 Jun 2022, this has not
   been accepted and has not seen activity in 2 years.

Configure Dropbox as a Service in HomeManager

   The dropbox package is better maintained than the dropbox-cli package. The
   follow sets up dropbox as a service in home manager (working in Sept.
   2024).

 {
     systemd.user.services.dropbox = {
         Unit = {
             Description = "Dropbox service";
         };
         Install = {
             WantedBy = [ "default.target" ];
         };
         Service = {
             ExecStart = "${pkgs.dropbox}/bin/dropbox";
             Restart = "on-failure";
         };
     };
 }

Alternative Open Source Client

   There is also an open source alternative called Maestral: maestral as CLI
   and maestral-gui for a GUI.
