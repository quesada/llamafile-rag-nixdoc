   eCryptfs is a cryptographic filesystem encrypting each file individually.
   To install ecryptfs add the following to environment.systemPackages:

 { pkgs, ... }: {
   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     ecryptfs
   ];
 }

   man ecryptfs-migrate-home describes how to encrypt your home folder. The
   TL;DR is that you need to: log out, log in as root, modprobe ecryptfs if
   needed, kill all processes that still access the home folder you want to
   migrate (check with lsof /home/YOURUSERNAME), wait for it to finish, then
   run ecryptfs-migrate-home -u YOURUSERNAME, then log in as your migrated
   user before rebooting.

   To automatically mount your private folder on login with PAM, add this to
   your config:

 {
   security.pam.enableEcryptfs = true;
 }

   Don't forget to also load the ecryptfs kernel module on boot as well in
   this case:

 {
   boot.kernelModules = ["ecryptfs"];
 }
