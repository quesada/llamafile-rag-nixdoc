   For private deployments, it can be desirable to reduce how often you reach
   out of your network and to an upstream. Mirroring all the dependencies
   internally means even if external services fail, your internal network is
   still functional. An additional reason to implement this is to reduce the
   external signals your deployment emits. For example, you may want to avoid
   exposing how often you fetch a specific file from an external service.

   The following location blocks can be used with Nginx to produce a
   transparent caching proxy to the upstream NixOS cache:

  location ~ ^/nix-cache-info {
     proxy_store        on;
     proxy_store_access user:rw group:rw all:r;
     proxy_temp_path    /data/nginx/nix-cache-info/temp;
     root               /data/nginx/nix-cache-info/store;

     proxy_set_header Host "cache.nixos.org";
     proxy_pass https://cache.nixos.org;
   }

   location ~^/nar/.+$ {
     proxy_store        on;
     proxy_store_access user:rw group:rw all:r;
     proxy_temp_path    /data/nginx/nar/temp;
     root               /data/nginx/nar/store;

     proxy_set_header Host "cache.nixos.org";
     proxy_pass https://cache.nixos.org;
   }

   The data paths must exist and be read/writable by the Nginx process. This
   configuration will transparently mirror the upstream
   https://cache.nixos.org packages on the proxy server when they are first
   fetched, meaning all future fetches of the same files are served from the
   local disk.
