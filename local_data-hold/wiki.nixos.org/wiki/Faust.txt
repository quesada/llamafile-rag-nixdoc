   Faust (Functional Audio Stream) is a functional programming language
   specifically designed for real-time signal processing and synthesis.

Faust in NixOS 22.05

   NixOS 22.05 contains Faust version 2.40.0.

   If you want to use the alsa-qt architecture, you need to apply an upstream
   patch, because the architecture file as provided in this version does not
   compile.

   Simply add the following overlay:

    (self: super: {
        faust = super.faust.overrideAttrs (old: {
          patches = (old.patches or [ ]) ++ [
            (super.fetchpatch {
              url =
                "https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/commit/cf80f4c94ac979922892a7f594121358cd178708.patch";
              sha256 = "sha256-MMFgCzAT33kwnBGvydyoqxJmMjWpxyF9Okjk1rMmrcw=";
            })
          ];
        });
      })
