   Firefox is a graphical web browser developed by Mozilla. It can be used
   with a Firefox Sync Server.

Installation

   Set programs.firefox.enable to true in your system or Home Manager
   configuration. Keep in mind that the NixOS and Home Manager modules have
   different options, so choose accordingly.

Firefox Variants

   There are several Firefox variants that you can choose to install. To
   choose a variant, set programs.firefox.package accordingly. Note: The
   packages for the variants listed below are installed instead of the normal
   firefox package. Thus, you'll have to choose one among these options.

  Variant: Official Binaries

   Mozilla provides official pre-built Firefox binaries. This is the
   firefox-bin package and will be downloaded directly from the Mozilla
   servers.

  Variant: ESR

   firefox-esr is the Extended Support Release of Firefox provided by
   Mozilla, which receives only security updates and a more relaxed cadence
   of feature implementation.

  Variant: Nightly

   Nightly builds are daily builds of Firefox from the central Mozilla
   repository.

    Reproducible

   This method uses flakes to pull in nightly versions of Firefox in a
   reproducible way, and is recommended for use. If you don't want to use
   flakes, check out the next section.

   First, add the following inputs to your flake:

 inputs = {
   firefox.url = "github:nix-community/flake-firefox-nightly";
   firefox.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
 };

   Then, using the specialArgs attribute to pass flake inputs to external
   configuration files, add the nightly package to your system:

 { pkgs, inputs, config, ... }:
 {
   environment.systemPackages = [
     inputs.firefox.packages.${pkgs.system}.firefox-nightly-bin
   ];
 }

   The downside of using this method is that you'll have to update the flake
   input before you can get a new nightly version, which also means that you
   might miss new builds since the flake lags behind the nightly release.

    Non-reproducible (Impure)

   Using this method is bad for reproducibility since it fetches resources
   from non-pinned URLs, but it also means you always get the latest nightly
   version when you build your system.

     Tip                                                                      
     If you don't want to use flakes but you still want to reproducibly       
     install Firefox nightly, you might want to use this method with niv.     

 nixpkgs.overlays =
   let
     # Change this to a rev sha to pin
     moz-rev = "master";
     moz-url = builtins.fetchTarball { url = "https://github.com/mozilla/nixpkgs-mozilla/archive/${moz-rev}.tar.gz";};
     nightlyOverlay = (import "${moz-url}/firefox-overlay.nix");
   in [
     nightlyOverlay
   ];
 programs.firefox.package = pkgs.latest.firefox-nightly-bin;

   Once you've added the overlay, you'll need to pass the --impure option to
   nix commands. For example, in order to build and activate your
   configuration, you'll have to run:

 $ nixos-rebuild switch --impure

Customizing with Home Manager

   Home manager allows more customization for firefox. Such as extensions,
   search engines, bookmarks, userChrome and user.js. The example below shows
   a basic config defining Nix packages & options as a search engine. More
   options are available on Home Manager's site

 home-manager.users.username = {
   programs.firefox = {
     enable = true;
     profiles = {
       "user" = {
         id = 0;
         isDefault = true;

         search.engines = {
           "Nix Packages" = {
             urls = [{
               template = "https://search.nixos.org/packages";
               params = [
                 { name = "query"; value = "{searchTerms}"; }
               ];
             }];
             icon = "${pkgs.nixos-icons}/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/nix-snowflake.svg";
             definedAliases = [ "@np" ];
           };
           "Nix Options" = {
             definedAliases = [ "@no" ];
             urls = [{
               template = "https://search.nixos.org/options";
               params = [
                 { name = "query"; value = "{searchTerms}"; }
               ];
             }];
           };
         };
       };
     };
   };

FAQ

  How do I use ALSA with Firefox instead of PulseAudio?

 programs.firefox.package = (pkgs.wrapFirefox.override { libpulseaudio = pkgs.libpressureaudio; }) pkgs.firefox-unwrapped { };

Tips

   === Enabling Plasma Browser Integration === 1. Add the following line to
   your configuration.nix (note that enabling Plasma automatically does
   this):

 programs.firefox.nativeMessagingHosts.packages = [ pkgs.plasma5Packages.plasma-browser-integration ];

   2. Install KDE's Firefox extension.

  Use KDE file picker

   You must instruct Firefox to use the file picker offered by the XDG
   Desktop Portal framework. This setting can be found in Firefox's
   about:config as widget.use-xdg-desktop-portal.file-picker. The value 1
   means "always". To set it using NixOS, add to 'configuration.nix'

   # Make Firefox use the KDE file picker.
   # Preferences source: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/firefox#KDE_integration
   programs.firefox = {
     enable = true;
     preferences = {
       "widget.use-xdg-desktop-portal.file-picker" = 1;
     };
   };

  Use xinput2

   You can make Firefox use xinput2 by setting the MOZ_USE_XINPUT2
   environment variable. This improves touchscreen support and enables
   additional touchpad gestures. It also enables smooth scrolling as opposed
   to the stepped scrolling that Firefox has by default. To do this, put the
   following in your config:

 environment.sessionVariables = {
   MOZ_USE_XINPUT2 = "1";
 };

Troubleshooting

  If you can't start the browser because of a configuration error

   For example:

 firefox
 1554035168269   Marionette      FATAL   XML parsing error: undefined entity
 Location: chrome://browser/content/browser.xul
 Line 2526, column 13:            <toolbarbutton id="tracking-protection-preferences-button"
 JavaScript error: resource:///modules/aboutpages/AboutPrivateBrowsingHandler.jsm, line 28: TypeError: this.pageListener is undefined

   An easy way to get away from this is to start firefox with the firefox
   -safe-mode command. Then you can troubleshoot your actual problem or you
   can call your luck by calling the refresh option (a special button will
   appear when firefox starts in this mode). This will reset your
   configuration to a sane state and you will be usually able to start the
   browser again, but you will lose most of your customization.

  nativeMessagingHosts doesn't work

   Such as enablePlasmaBrowserIntegration, enableGnomeExtensions, and
   enableBrowserpass.

   They do not work with the firefox-bin derivation^[1] or with firefox
   installed via nix-env

  Screen Sharing under Wayland

   When using Firefox with Wayland, screen sharing options might be limited
   and require additional configuration (exact capabilities vary with
   different compositors).

     * add Pipewire support to Firefox:

 # when programs.firefox.enable == true
 programs.firefox.wrapperConfig = {
   pipewireSupport = true;
 };

 # or, alternatively

 environment.systemPackages = [
   # Replace this
   pkgs.firefox
   # With this
   (pkgs.wrapFirefox (pkgs.firefox-unwrapped.override { pipewireSupport = true;}) {})
 ];

     * Enable PipeWire

 services.pipewire.enable = true;

     * Enable xdg desktop integration:

 xdg = {
   portal = {
     enable = true;
     extraPortals = with pkgs; [
       xdg-desktop-portal-wlr
       xdg-desktop-portal-gtk
     ];
   };
 };

     * Set environment variables to hint Firefox to use Wayland features.
       E.g.:

 # Classical NixOS setup
 environment.sessionVariables = {
   # only needed for Sway
   XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP = "sway";
 };

 # Home Manager setup
 home.sessionVariables = {
   # only needed for Sway
   XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP = "sway";
 };

     * Ensure that the environment variables are correctly set for the user
       systemd units, e.g.
    1. Sway users might achieve this by adding the following to their Sway
       config file
    2. This ensures all user units started after the command (not those
       already running) set the variables

 exec systemctl --user import-environment
