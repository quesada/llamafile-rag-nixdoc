   The Gnome calendar is the desktop calendar application built into GNOME.

Using Gnome Calendar outside of GNOME

   To use the gnome calendar outside of gnome, you need the following lines
   in your configuration.nix:

 {
   programs.dconf.enable = true;
   services.gnome.evolution-data-server.enable = true;
   # optional to use google/nextcloud calendar
   services.gnome.gnome-online-accounts.enable = true;
   # optional to use google/nextcloud calendar
   services.gnome.gnome-keyring.enable = true;
 }

   External calendar such as google/nextcloud can be only added via the
   gnome-control-center:

 $ nix-shell -p gnome.gnome-control-center --run "gnome-control-center"

   then add your accounts in the "Online Accounts" submenu.

   If gnome-control-center will not launch, it's possible the value of
   XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP needs to be changed to GNOME during launch. This is
   the case when using the Hyprland window manager.

 $ XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=GNOME gnome-control-center

   This should launch gnome-control-center and allow you to access the Online
   Accounts submenu.

   To get alarm reminders you need to start the evolution-alarm-notify daemon
   provided by the gnome.evolution-data-server package. When you enable
   services.gnome.evolution-data-server.enable it will add a desktop
   autostart entry to
   /run/current-system/sw/etc/xdg/autostart/org.gnome.Evolution-alarm-notify.desktop.
   If your desktop manager does not process autostart entries, you can use
   dex instead:

 $ dex --autostart

   As an alternative you can start
   libexec/evolution-data-server/evolution-alarm-notify from the
   gnome.evolution-data-server directly.
