Game starters

   Games can be run by different applications. Some are able to include
   libraries from different plattforms.

   Application Platform                      Remarks                          
                                             Windows games work fine. Linux   
   Steam       Steam                         games are often incompatible due 
                                             to how NixOS works.

   Heroic      Epic, GOG, Prime Gaming, Wine 
                                             often easier to use Lutris

                                             There are several games in

  Renowned Explorers: International Society

   Tested with version renowned_explorers_international_society_522_26056.sh
   from gog.com. It can be played with steam-run, but it needs some libraries
   that are not normally included in Steam's FHS environment. One way to
   solve this is to add an overlay:

   nixpkgs.overlays = [
     (self: super: {
       steam-run = (super.steam.override {
         extraLibraries = pkgs: with pkgs;
           [
             libxkbcommon
             mesa
             wayland
             (sndio.overrideAttrs (old: {
               postFixup = old.postFixup + ''
                 ln -s $out/lib/libsndio.so $out/lib/libsndio.so.6.1
               '';
             }))
           ];
       }).run;
     })
   ];

   Adding libxkbcommon, mesa, and wayland is straightforward. The game
   expects the shared library sdnio.so.6.1 to exist, so we need to create a
   symbolic link after the installation of sndio.
