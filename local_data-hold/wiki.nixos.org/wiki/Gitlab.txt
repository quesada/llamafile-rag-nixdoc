   From NixOS Wiki

   The GitLab web application offers git repository management, code reviews,
   issue tracking, activity feeds and wikis.

   This article is an extension of the NixOS manual.

Installation

   A minimal local installation of Gitlab might look like this

 services.gitlab = {
   enable = true;
   databasePasswordFile = pkgs.writeText "dbPassword" "zgvcyfwsxzcwr85l";
   initialRootPasswordFile = pkgs.writeText "rootPassword" "dakqdvp4ovhksxer";
   secrets = {
     secretFile = pkgs.writeText "secret" "Aig5zaic";
     otpFile = pkgs.writeText "otpsecret" "Riew9mue";
     dbFile = pkgs.writeText "dbsecret" "we2quaeZ";
     jwsFile = pkgs.runCommand "oidcKeyBase" {} "${pkgs.openssl}/bin/openssl genrsa 2048 > $out";
   };
 };

 services.nginx = {
   enable = true;
   recommendedProxySettings = true;
   virtualHosts = {
     localhost = {
       locations."/".proxyPass = "http://unix:/run/gitlab/gitlab-workhorse.socket";
     };
   };
 };

 services.openssh.enable = true;

 systemd.services.gitlab-backup.environment.BACKUP = "dump";

   After applying the configuration head to http://localhost and login with
   username root and the password specified in initialRootPasswordFile.

   Even though it is easy to provide the secrets in the configuration.nix
   with pkgs.writeText, keep in mind that it might not be the best method,
   because they get written to the world readable nix-store this way. A safer
   solution is to put them somewhere in the file system with the right chmod
   and owner set and include them using ./<filename> or to use a secret
   managment tool

   Note: Since the version 15.7 GitLab blocks weak passwords^[1] on
   self-managed instances by default and providing one in
   initialRootPasswordFile results in a silent failure to create root user.

Maintenance

   Query info about your Gitlab instance

 gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info

   Check for configuration errors

 gitlab-rake gitlab:check

Tips and tricks

  Run Gitlab behind reverse proxy

   In case your Gitlab instance is running behind a reverse proxy which does
   offer TLS encryption, you might need to adapt your configuration

 services.gitlab = {
   [...]
   https = true;
   port = 443;
   host = "git.example.org";
 };

  Migrating an existing Gitlab to a Nixos installation

   Make a backup on the on the old installation following the Gitlab backup
   guide. It is important to be on the same version and edition that you want
   to install on your new server.

   Then install a Gitlab on the NixOS. Make sure you set the same secrets
   like on the old installation.

   After a successful deploy:

    1. Stop the Gitlab service using systemctl stop gitlab.service.
    2. Start Gitaly systemctl start gitaly.service
          * It gets stopped when gitlab.service stops.
    3. Then copy the backup *_gitlab_backup.tar to the backup folder
          * cp 1719619965_2024_06_29_16.11.4_gitlab_backup.tar
            /var/gitlab/state/backup
    4. Run sudo -u gitlab gitlab-rake gitlab:backup:restore BACKUP=<name
       before the _gitlab_backup.tar> .
          * For example sudo -u gitlab gitlab-rake gitlab:backup:restore
            BACKUP=1719619965_2024_06_29_16.11.4
    5. You will be interactively asked what should be done.
          * You will most likely be saying yes hrtr
    6. Start the Gitlab Service again using systemctl start gitlab.service.

   You may need to rebuild the system for everything to properly come up.

Troubleshooting

  Error 422 The change you requested was rejected on login

   There might be different reasons for this error to show up after a failing
   login. One possible issue could be that your Gitlab instance is configured
   to be served with SSL encryption but running unencrypted behind a reverse
   proxy

 services.gitlab = {
   enable = true;
   port = 443;
   https = true;
 [...]

   To solve this, add following http headers to your upstream reverse proxy.
   In this example for the web server Caddy but it can be set for others too

 caddy = {
   enable = true;
   virtualHosts = {
     "git.example.org".extraConfig = ''
       reverse_proxy http://10.100.0.3 {
         header_up X-Forwarded-Proto https
         header_up X-Forwarded-Ssl on
       }
     '';
   };
 };

Notes

   Gitlab will add a user "gitlab" to your NixOS, many tutorials online point
   to using git over ssh with the user "git", which in our case will not
   match since there is no user "git". If you configure your SSH hosts with
   ~/.ssh/config this should work:

  Host your.selfhosted.com
    HostName your.selfhosted.com
    User gitlab
    IdentityFile /path/to/your/ssh/private/key
    # The following are optional:
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    PreferredAuthentications publickey
