Identifying your computer

  $ cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_{family,name}
 MacBook
 MacBook2,1

   The last line is the 'version field; the key to your success. This will
   allow you to identify with great accuracy the hardware. Fixes for other
   versions may apply too, but the greater the gap between revisions, the
   less likely it is to work.

Auto Restart

   Older Apple hardware had an elegent solution to enable automatic restart
   on power failure. The physical power button, when depressed, could be
   rotated through 90 degrees and in this position it remained permanently
   on. This function is now handled through software setting registers in the
   PMU, except that in some models this setting does not persist across
   reboots. the following may be of help if you are looking to use a Mac-Mini
   as a server

 { config, pkgs, options, lib, ... }:

 with lib;

 let
         register =
         {
                 "mini_white_intel+nVidia" = "00:03.0 0x7b.b=0x19";
                 "mini_white_intel" = "0:1f.0 0xa4.b=0";
