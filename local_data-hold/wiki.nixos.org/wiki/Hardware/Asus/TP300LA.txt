Hardware Support

   Note: The i5-4210U and Intel integrated GPU version was tested^[1]. Many
   versions of the TP300LA exists.

   Most hardware functions as expected without changes, this includes
   brightness, wifi, bluetooth, webcam, sound and HDMI out.

   Only specific or uncommon hardware notes have been added.

  Function keys

   Function keys for airplane mode, brightness, screen disable, and volume
   works^[2]. The screen setup function key is mapping to Super_L+P. The
   windows key on the side of the device will map to a Super_L press and
   release on release, there is no way to map to it being held.

   The auto brightness key doesn't map to anything.

  Sensors

   Both orientation sensors and light sensors are supported under NixOS
   17.09, using IIO^[3].

   The orientation sensor isn't oriented like the screen, PR#7752 on
   systemd will add the required configuration upstream, hopefully it will be
   present in the next stable release of NixOS.

   Meanwhile, adding this to your configuration.nix will configure the sensor
   appropriately.

 { config }:
 {
   hardware.sensor.iio.enable = true;
   # Accelerometer orientation; upstreaming in preogress.
   # https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/7752
   services.udev.extraHwdb = ''
     sensor:modalias:acpi:INVN6500*:dmi:*svn*ASUSTeK*:*pn*TP300LA*
      ACCEL_MOUNT_MATRIX=0, 1, 0; 1, 0, 0; 0, 0, 1
   '';
 }

   A reboot may be the easiest way to refresh everything for
   iio-sensor-proxy. Test using monitor-sensor.
