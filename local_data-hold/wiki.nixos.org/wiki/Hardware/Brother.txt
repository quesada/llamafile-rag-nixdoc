Troubleshooting

  With proper paper setting, printout is shifted or cropped

   This may happen because of the way the brother drivers are made, it seems
   there is a bug in the handling of paper type, and it does not only affect
   NixOS.

   To see if this problem affects you, look at the `rc` file for your
   printer, in the package for your drivers.

 /nix/store/.../opt/brother/Printers/[model]/inf/br[model]rc

   There will be a line as such:

 PaperType=A4

   The problem can be inverted depending on the driver, some will default to
   A4 and some to Letter.

   One way this can be worked-around is by patching the rc file at build
   time^[1]. This will not allow switching paper type at runtime.
