Displaylink Graphic Driver

   The Displaylink entry shows all the steps in getting the graphics part of
   the Universal Dock / Docking Station up and running.

Enabling IPv6

   So there seems to be an issue in the kernel drivers which makes Ethernet
   Multicast not working with this docking station (bug report and patches
   here). Somehow these patches or workarounds never got upstream, but with
   this code snippet you can include the patches easily inside your
   configuration.nix if you put the patches in a subdirectory for instance
   linux_kernel_cdc_ncm_patches:

 {
   ...
   boot.kernelPatches = lib.singleton {
     name = "enable-d6000";
     patch = [
       ./linux_kernel_cdc_ncm_patches/0001-Hook-into-usbnet_change_mtu-respecting-usbnet-driver.patch
       ./linux_kernel_cdc_ncm_patches/0002-Admit-multicast-traffic.patch
     ];
   };
   ...
 }
