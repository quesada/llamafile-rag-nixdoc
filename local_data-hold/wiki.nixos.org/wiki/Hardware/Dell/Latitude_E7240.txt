Booting

   If the UEFI partitioning scheme is used when installing NixOS, the device
   might throw an invalid partition table error when powered on.

   To resolve this issue, enter the UEFI settings menu by holding F2,
   navigate to the General > Boot Sequence section, then change the Boot List
   Option setting from Legacy to UEFI.

Fingerprint reader

   The device has a built-in fingerprint reader, the BCM5880 Secure
   Applications Processor with fingerprint swipe sensor.^[1]

   Broadcom has not provided Linux drivers for the fingerprint reader as of
   this writing (2024 July 31).^[2]^[3]^[4]^[5]^[6]

Firmware updates

   The device supports firmware updates through fwupd.

S.M.A.R.T. monitoring

   Main article: smartmontools

   The device supports S.M.A.R.T. monitoring, but it must be turned on in the
   UEFI settings.

Smartcard reader

   The device has a built-in smartcard reader through BCM5880 Secure
   Applications Processor with fingerprint swipe sensor.^[1]

   The CCID package does not support this reader.^[7]
