   Framework Laptop 16
   Laptop 16    
   Manufacturer Framework       
   Architecture x86_64-linux    
   7040 Series  
   Status       maybe supported 

   The Framework Laptop 16 is a configurable, upgradeable, and repairable
   laptop made by the Framework company.

Status

   The device boots NixOS.

Known issues

   The device still has a couple of hardware quirks (see below).

   Using the latest kernel will fix some issues. Also read configuration
   hints in this article.

Configuration

   Framework specific NixOS hardware options are bundled within the
   nixos-hardware project.

  AMD 7040 Series

   It is recommended to use power-profiles-daemon over tlp for the AMD
   framework.

     * NixOS Hardware module for flakes:
       nixos-hardware.nixosModules.framework-16-7040-amd
     * NixOS Hardware module for channels:
       <nixos-hardware/framework/16-inch/7040-amd>

  Fix Color accuracy in Power Saving modes

   Active Backlight Management is used to reduce battery power consumption
   causing the colors of the screen to be inaccurate.

   Some desktop environments may already be able to modify this setting.

   To disable it add the kernel parameter:

 boot.kernelParams = [ "amdgpu.abmlevel=0" ];

  Touchpad Palm Rejection

   Prior to libinput 1.26, the Framework 16 keyboard was treated as an
   external USB device by libinput, causing the touchpad to stay enabled when
   typing.

   NixOS Unstable has updated libinput and is not affected. On NixOS 24.05
   and earlier, this can be worked around with a libinput quirk (sourced from
   here: community.frame.work by: @sumiflow)

 environment.etc = {
   "libinput/local-overrides.quirks".text = ''
     [Keyboard]
     MatchUdevType=keyboard
     MatchName=Framework Laptop 16 Keyboard Module - ANSI Keyboard
     AttrKeyboardIntegration=internal
   '';
 };

  Prevent wake up in backpack

   Putting your Framework in a backpack can cause it to wake up due to the
   screen flexing onto the keyboard. While this is not resolved in Firmware,
   you can workaround this issue with a udev rule:

 services.udev.extraRules = ''
    ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", DRIVERS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="32ac", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0012", ATTR{power/wakeup}="disabled", ATTR{driver/1-1.1.1.4/power/wakeup}="disabled"
    ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", DRIVERS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="32ac", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0014", ATTR{power/wakeup}="disabled", ATTR{driver/1-1.1.1.4/power/wakeup}="disabled"
 '';

   The Product and Vendor IDs can be found using lsusb.

   This does not prevent the trackpad from waking up the device. This however
   seems to happen less in a backpack.

  Bios Configuration

   Enable Linux Audio Compatibility in the bios to improve speaker audio
   quality.

External resources

   There is a nixos thread on the framework forum, where you can find
   additional help, guidance and example configurations.
