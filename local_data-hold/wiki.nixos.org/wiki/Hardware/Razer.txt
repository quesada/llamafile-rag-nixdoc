OpenRazer

   OpenRazer is an open-source project to support Razer peripherals,
   including those found in their laptops. To enable the OpenRazer you need
   to add the following to your configuration.nix

   hardware.openrazer.enable = true;
   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
       openrazer-daemon
    ];

   To run the openrazer-daemon, you need to be in the openrazer group.

 users.users.<username> = { extraGroups = [ "openrazer" ]; };

   To enable a front-end to control the peripherals, add the following to
   your configuration

   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
       polychromatic
   ];

Razer Blade 15 Advanced (Early 2020 model)

  Lid reopen hybernate issue

   Upon closing the lid to the laptop and reopening, an issue occurs where
   the device will intermittently go back into hybernate mode after around
   10-30 seconds. Setting the kernel parameter button.lid_init_state=open
   fixes this issue. The following is an example configuration (working in
   NixOS 22.05):

   boot.kernelParams = [ "button.lid_init_state=open" ];

  Getting the Nvidia card to work properly with external displays

   In order to get both the laptop display and external displays working, in
   the BIOS settings set Chipset > GPU MODE to "Dedicated GPU only".

   After setting the GPU MODE to "Dedicated GPU only" in the BIOS, enabling
   Nvidia is necessary in order for both the laptop's display and external
   display/ports to work properly. Here is an example configuration snippet
   for NixOS 22.05:

   services.xserver = {
     videoDrivers = [ "nvidia" ];
   };
   hardware.opengl.enable = true;
   hardware.nvidia.package = config.boot.kernelPackages.nvidiaPackages.beta;
  
   hardware.nvidia = {
     powerManagement.enable = true;
     modesetting.enable = true;
     prime = {
       sync.enable = true;
       nvidiaBusId = "PCI:1:0:0";
       intelBusId = "PCI:0:2:0";
     };
   };

Updating your system to use the unstable drivers and daemon

   If you are using a new model from razer it probably is not available in
   the stable packages. But it might be available in the unstable ones.

   In your configuration.nix file:

  nixpkgs.config = {
     allowUnfree = true;

     packageOverrides = pkgs: {
       stable = import <nixos-stable> {config = config.nixpkgs.config;};
       unstable = import (fetchTarball "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/nixos-unstable.tar.gz") { config = config.nixpkgs.config; };
     };
   };

 # updates the whole kernel to unstable so you have the correct drivers.
 boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.unstable.linuxPackages;

 # overrides the openrazer-daemon that the harware.openrazer.enable starts
   nixpkgs.overlays = [
     (final: prev: {
       openrazer-daemon = pkgs.unstable.openrazer-daemon;
     })
   ];

   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     unstable.polychromatic
 # alternatively
 #    unstable.razergenie
   ];

USB disable Issues

   If you are encountering issues that your Razer keyboard does light up on
   boot shortly and then can not be found by the open-razer-daemon until you
   unplug your USB cable and re-plug it. Then you might want to reset your
   USB on startup so that after login the daemon finds it again.

   # Razer usb reset. Since it disables somehow on boot.
   systemd.services."usb-reset" = {
     description = "Resets usb port for my Razer Keyboard";
     after = ["multi-user.target"];
     serviceConfig = {
         User = "root";
         Type = "simple";
         ExecStart=pkgs.writeShellScript "unit-restart-usb7_3" ''
           echo '7-3' |tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb/unbind
           echo '7-3' |tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb/bind
         '';
         KillMode = "process";
         Restart = "on-failure";
     };
     wantedBy = ["graphical.target"];
   };
   systemd.services."usb-reset".enable = true;

   7-3 is the Bus: 7 and the Port: 3

   How to figure those out you can read here:

   https://superuser.com/questions/1707773/how-to-turn-usb-connected-device-on-and-off-in-linux

   If that does not work, you can reset all usb controllers instead:

   # Razer usb reset. Since it disables somehow on boot.
   systemd.services."usb-reset" = {
     description = "Resets usb port for my Razer Keyboard";
     after = ["multi-user.target"];
     serviceConfig = {
         User = "root";
         Type = "simple";
         ExecStart=pkgs.writeShellScript "unit-restart-usb-controller" ''
           #!/usr/bin/env bash
           # Resets all USB host controllers of the system.
           # This is useful in case one stopped working
           # due to a faulty device having been connected to it.

           sleep_secs="1"

           # * 'xhci_hcd' - USB 3.0
           echo "Looking for USB standards ..."
           for usb_std in "$base/"?hci[-_]?c*
           do
               echo "* USB standard '$usb_std' ..."
               for dev_path in "$usb_std/"*:*
               do
                   dev="$(basename "$dev_path")"
                   echo "  - Resetting device '$dev' ..."
                   printf '%s' "$dev" | tee "$usb_std/unbind" > /dev/null
                   sleep "$sleep_secs"
                   printf '%s' "$dev" | tee "$usb_std/bind" > /dev/null

         '';
