   TUXEDO Computers is a German company that specializes in assembling
   devices specifically designed to work out-of-the-box with Linux OSes.

   When configured with their flagship distro, TUXEDO devices offer
   particular integrations with the Linux kernel, allowing fan management,
   CPU underclocking, power profile selection and the tweaking of other
   hardware-related settings via the preinstalled Tuxedo Control Center and
   Kernel modules.

   In case you installed NixOS on a TUXEDO computer, however, you will have
   to specifically configure your system in order to gain access to those
   functionalities.

Tuxedo Control Center

   The Tuxedo Control Center is an open source utility developed by TUXEDO
   Computers to provide a GUI interface for managing thermal and power
   settings on TUXEDO laptops.

   As of today, the Tuxedo Control Center is unfortunately not available in
   Nixpkgs, making it impossible to install it right away.

   Thanks to a project maintained by blitz (Julian Stecklina), however, you
   can set up the TCC on NixOS just by importing an external module hosted on
   GitHub.

   Doing this operation is quite straightforward, whether your system is
   configured to use Flakes or not.

  Installation with Flakes

   At the time of writing, the Flake interface is still experimental, but is
   stable enough to use it to import and enable this module in your system
   configuration.

   Here you can find what you should add to your flake.nix to install the
   TCC:

 {
   inputs = {
     nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-22.11";
     tuxedo-nixos = {
       url = "github:blitz/tuxedo-nixos";
       inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
     };
   };

   outputs = { self, nixpkgs, tuxedo-nixos }: {
     nixosConfigurations = {
       your-system = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
         modules = [
           ./configuration.nix
           tuxedo-nixos.nixosModules.default
           { hardware.tuxedo-control-center.enable = true; }
         ];
       };
     };
   };
 }

  Installation without Flakes

   In case you prefer to avoid enabling and using Flakes, the Tuxedo Control
   Center can be installed in the old and stable way:

 { config, pkgs, ... }:
 let
   tuxedo = import (builtins.fetchTarball "https://github.com/blitz/tuxedo-nixos/archive/master.tar.gz");
 in {
   imports = [
     tuxedo.module
   ];
   hardware.tuxedo-control-center.enable = true;
 }

  Troubleshooting on Nixpkgs > 22.11

   As noted in an issue on the project's GitHub page^[1], blitz's TCC
   distribution is tested exclusively against Nixpkgs 22.11; as such, there
   might be errors when building it after overriding its Nixpkgs version to a
   newer one.

   To avoid such problems, it can be useful to delete the
   inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs"; line in the example above and to
   specify hardware.tuxedo-control-center.package =
   tuxedo-nixos.packages.x86_64-linux.default; right after the enable
   instruction. Doing this, in fact, will build the TCC against the Nixpkgs
   version it is meant to.

Tuxedo Keyboard

   The keyboard installed on some TUXEDO Laptops has a variable color
   backlight that, once a specific Kernel module is inserted, can be
   controlled via the TCC (since version 3.2.0 of the module) or via some
   Kernel commandline parameters (up to version 3.1.4 of the module).

   The tuxedo-keyboard module is currently present on Nixpkgs and can easily
   be enabled by adding the hardware.tuxedo-keyboard.enable = true; option to
   your NixOS configuration. If you are on version 3.2.0 (or later) this one
   will be the only change that you'll need to do in the configuration, as
   the backlight control will then be available directly from "Tools" >
   "Keyboard Backlight" in the Tuxedo Control Center (see above if you
   haven't installed it yet).

   If you installed tuxedo-keyboard 3.1.4 (or older), however, you'll have to
   add the tuxedo_keyboard options to the Kernel commandline by using the
   boot.kernelParams; config key as in the example below:

 { pkgs, ... }:
 {
   hardware.tuxedo-keyboard.enable = true;
   boot.kernelParams = [
     "tuxedo_keyboard.mode=0"
     "tuxedo_keyboard.brightness=25"
     "tuxedo_keyboard.color_left=0x0000ff"
   ];
 }

   More options can be found in the official tuxedo_keyboard docs.
