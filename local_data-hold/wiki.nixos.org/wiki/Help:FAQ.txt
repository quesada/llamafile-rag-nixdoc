   link to go to the FAQ.

Splitting a FAQ entry into a sub-page

   This is done in four steps:

    1. Create the new page using the "short" URL. (FAQ/unfree, FAQ/Libraries)
    2. Include the whole content of the entry, wrap this way:

 {{FAQ/breadcrumb}}{{#tweekihide:firstHeading}}<onlyinclude>
 == How can I install a proprietary or unfree package? ==
 ... page contents here. ...
 </onlyinclude>

    3. Transclude the page (prefer using the short link)

 {{:FAQ/unfree}}

    4. Move the page from the short to the full title link.
