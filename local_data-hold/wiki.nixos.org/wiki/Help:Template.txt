   From NixOS Wiki

   The wiki provides templates for common tasks.

   Those templates can range from simple to complex, being almost invisible
   to the end-user to provide a complete harmonized template between
   articles.

   In addition to the visual aspect, using some templates will automatically
   file and categorize articles in ways indispensable to the end-users.

Available templates

   These templates are meant to be used across the whole wiki.

   There are other section-specific templates, and templates for internal use
   available too.

  Article status

   These templates should be added to either the top of a page, or the top of
   a section, when needed.

     * {{outdated}} for when a page or a section is outdated.
     * {{expansion}} for when a page or section needs expansion.
     * {{merge}} for when a a page or a section may need to be merged into
       another.
     * {{disambiguation}} for when a page name is ambiguous, to link to
       another.
     * {{low quality}} for when a page or a section is of low quality.

  Note templates

   These templates are purposefully intrusive, and serve as a visual landmark
   to an important note.

     * {{tip}} for a tip.
     * {{warning}} for a non-security warning.
     * {{Security Warning}} for a security warning.

   These templates should be used sparingly, but are useful as they are less
   intrusive.

     * {{note}} for a note.
     * {{aside}} for an aside comment about a section.

  Prefab tips

   Common repeated tips in template form.

     * {{evaluate}} reminder to evaluate a NixOS configuration with
       nixos-rebuild.
     * {{unfree}} a note that a package is unfree, with a link for more help.

  Formatting

    Misc. prefabs

     * {{app}} for a card with details about an application.
     * {{man}} to refer to a man page (and section).

    Code and commands

     * {{commands}} for a list of commands.
     * {{file}} for a formatted code block with a filename header.
     * Prefer the SyntaxHighlight extension with e.g. <syntaxhighlight
       lang="nix"></syntaxhighlight> otherwise.

   These are more raw implementation blocks. They are not recommended for
   broad use.

     * {{ic}} for inline code.
     * {{bc}} for a block of code.

  Nix, Nixpkgs and NixOS

   These helpers link to specific project parts.

    Nix

     * {{nix:option}} links to a given Nix option documentation.
     * {{Nix Manual}} links to the Nix manual (with optional chapter and
       version).

    Nixpkgs

     * {{Nixpkgs Link}} links to a given Nixpkgs file (with optional
       revision).
     * {{Nixpkgs Manual}} links to the Nixpkgs manual (with optional chapter
       and version).

    NixOS

     * {{nixos:package}} links to a given NixOS package search result.
     * {{nixos:option}} links to a given NixOS option search result.
     * {{NixOS Manual}} links to the NixOS manual (with optional chapter and
       version).

    Other links

     * {{issue}} to link to a Nixpkgs issue.
     * {{pull}} to link to a Nixpkgs pull request.

  Page construction

   Templates helping in building pages with common forms.

     * {{lowercase title}} to lowercase the first character of a page name.
     * {{main}} to refer back to a main article.
     * {{PrefixIndex}} to add a list of pages starting with a given prefix.

Visual Guidelines

   The icons used are from Breeze, the default icon set of KDE.

   Since the icons from Breeze are used, the colours from HIG, which is the
   Breeze Color Palette are used.

   Sometimes, there isn't an icon in the Breeze theme that can be used for
   the purpose. In this case, alternative free and open source icons can be
   used. Once a stand-in is used, someone with the necessary skills can
   create the needed icon in the breeze style.
