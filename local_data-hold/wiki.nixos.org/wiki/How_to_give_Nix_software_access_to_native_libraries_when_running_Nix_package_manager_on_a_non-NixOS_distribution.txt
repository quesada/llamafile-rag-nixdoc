   This page is currently work-in-progress, this is a draft of what is to
   come.

   When running the Nix package manager on a Linux distribution that isn't
   NixOS, you may want to run software installed through the Nix package
   manager that requires using you Linux distribution's installed libraries
   in order to function properly on your system.

   A commonly required native distribution library is a custom LibGL library
   packaged with Nvidia's proprietary GPU drivers which is required in order
   for 3D applications to work with these drivers. Example errors:

   error while loading shared libraries: libGL.so.1: cannot open shared
   object file: No such file or directory

 libGL error: unable to load driver: i965_dri.so
 libGL error: driver pointer missing
 libGL error: failed to load driver: i965
 libGL error: unable to load driver: i965_dri.so
 libGL error: driver pointer missing
 libGL error: failed to load driver: i965
 libGL error: unable to load driver: swrast_dri.so
 libGL error: failed to load driver: swrast [glfw error 65543]:
 GLX: Failed to create context: GLXBadFBConfig Failed to create a window a

   To solve this, we make a copy of these needed native system libraries,
   patch them to look for any libraries *they* need in the distribution's
   native libraries (I assume Nix software then learns to delegate library
   search locations to the libs), and finally we tell the Nix-packaged
   software to look for their needed libraries in this folder containing our
   native libraries (which have in turn been patched to look for their own
   dependencies in our native distribution's library path).

   Solution:
