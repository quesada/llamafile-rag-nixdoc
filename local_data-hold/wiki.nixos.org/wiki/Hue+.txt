   From NixOS Wiki

   HUE+ is a digital lighting solution for the PC by NZXT.

   As of writing, there is no native NixOS configuration for it. However,
   with the open source program hue-plus and a simple systemd service, this
   can be done easily.

                                 Example config

 # /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
 { config, pkgs, ... }:

 {
   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     # ...
     hue-plus
     # ...
   ];
  
   systemd.services.nzxthue = {
     # You can obviously the candlelight mode & value! I just think this looks nice <3
     script= "${pkgs.hue-plus}/bin/hue candlelight ff3700";
     wantedBy = [ "multi-user.target" ];
   };
 }
