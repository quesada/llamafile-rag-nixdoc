   i3 is a tiling window manager for X.

Enabling

   To use i3 set services.xserver.windowManager.i3.enable to true. For
   example:

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 { config, pkgs, callPackage, ... }:

 {
   ...
   environment.pathsToLink = [ "/libexec" ]; # links /libexec from derivations to /run/current-system/sw
   ...
   services.xserver = {
     enable = true;

     desktopManager = {
       xterm.enable = false;
     };
   
     displayManager = {
         defaultSession = "none+i3";
     };

     windowManager.i3 = {
       enable = true;
       extraPackages = with pkgs; [
         dmenu #application launcher most people use
         i3status # gives you the default i3 status bar
         i3lock #default i3 screen locker
         i3blocks #if you are planning on using i3blocks over i3status
      ];
     };
   };
   ...
 }

    Tip                                                                       
    In order to affect your system by your nix-language-specific changes you  
    have to evaluate it, run (as root):                                       
                                                                              
    # nixos-rebuild switch                                                    

  Using home-manager

 ~/.config/nixpkg/home.nix

 #in configuration.nix
 services.xserver = {
   enable = true;
   windowManager.i3.enable = true;
   };
   services.displayManager = {
     defaultSession = "none+i3";
   };

 #in home.nix
   xsession.windowManager.i3 = {
     enable = true;
     package = pkgs.i3-gaps;
     config = {
       modifier = "Mod4";
       gaps = {
         inner = 10;
         outer = 5;
       };
     };
   };

  With a desktop manager

   i3 is a window manager and does not provide "cosmetic" services like
   managing multiple monitor configuration or media keys. This is what is
   usually delegated to a desktop manager. To use xfce as a desktop manager
   on top of i3, see
   Xfce#Using_as_a_desktop_manager_and_not_a_window_manager.

  I3-gaps fork

   To use i3-gaps fork, the following line should be added to the
   configuration.nix:

   services.xserver.windowManager.i3.package = pkgs.i3-gaps;

Tips & tricks

  i3blocks

   After installing and enabling i3blocks, you may notice that i3block won't
   work. why?

   It seems that i3blocks read it's contents from a hardcoded path in /etc by
   default. Since in nixos, this path look something like:

 Path of i3blocks in nixos

   /nix/store/k78nc1bplhy4yjblqwlc14h6rdisix3w-i3blocks-1.4/libexec/i3blocks/[BLOCKS]

   And it can't find this path, so we have to create a link to this path by
   adding this line to configuration.nix file:

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

   environment.pathsToLink = [ "/libexec" ];

   Finally, your block may looks like:

 ~/.config/i3/i3blocks.conf

 [battery]                                                                                                       
 label=âš¡                                                                                                        
 command=/run/current-system/sw/libexec/i3blocks/battery                                                         
 interval=10                                                                                                     
 instance=1

  DConf

   If your settings aren't being saved for some applications (gtk3
   applications, firefox), like the size of file selection windows, or the
   size of the save dialog, you will need to enable dconf:

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

   programs.dconf.enable = true;

  Lxappearance

   To change the icon and themes you can install lxappearance:

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     #---- i3
     lxappearance
     ...
 ]

  Solve inconsistency between gtk2 and gtk3 themes

   If enabling dconf or installing Lxappearance but still see inconsistency
   between themes, you have to manually edit their configurations. In fact,
   It is possible to install some gtk3 themes but when you start another gtk2
   application, your theme not effected properly. It's because there is no
   .gtkrc-2.0 in your home directory. First create it and paste these lines
   to it:

 ~/.gtkrc-2.0

 gtk-theme-name="Sierra-compact-light"
 gtk-icon-theme-name="ePapirus"
 gtk-font-name="Ubuntu 11"
 gtk-cursor-theme-name="Deepin"
 gtk-cursor-theme-size=0
 gtk-toolbar-style=GTK_TOOLBAR_BOTH
 gtk-toolbar-icon-size=GTK_ICON_SIZE_LARGE_TOOLBAR
 gtk-button-images=1
 gtk-menu-images=1
 gtk-enable-event-sounds=1
 gtk-enable-input-feedback-sounds=1
 gtk-xft-antialias=1
 gtk-xft-hinting=1
 gtk-xft-hintstyle="hintfull"
 gtk-xft-rgba="rgb"
 gtk-modules="gail:atk-bridge"

   Change the options based on your installed themes and icon packs.

  Wallpaper

   If ~/.background-image exists then it will be displayed as a wallpaper.
   Options services.xserver.desktopManager.wallpaper.combineScreens and .mode
   control exactly how it is displayed.

  i3status-rust with home-manager

   i3status-rust can be configured through home-manager, but that
   configuration does not autoamatically update i3 to invoke i3status-rust.
   Instead xsession.windowManager.i3.config.bars needs to be updated to
   reference i3status-rust and the config files that the home-manager config
   produces. Consider the following setup:

 ~/.config/nixpkg/home.nix

   xsession.windowManager.i3 = {
     enable = true;
     config = {
       bars = [
         {
           position = "top";
           statusCommand = "${pkgs.i3status-rust}/bin/i3status-rs ~/.config/i3status-rust/config-top.toml";
         }
       ];
     };
   };

   programs.i3status-rust = {
     enable = true;
     bars = {
       top = {
         blocks = [
          {
            block = "time";
            interval = 60;
            format = "%a %d/%m %k:%M %p";
          }
        ];
       };
     };
   };
 }

  i3status with home-manager

   Same as in i3status-rust. Notice: home-manager will not override your
   existing config, i.e. if the file/folder ~/.config/i3status/config is
   present on your system, there won't be any changes after rebuilding.

   External resources that can help you with your setup:
   https://mynixos.com/home-manager/options/xsession.windowManager.i3.config

      To enable i3status in home-manager and change some basic options:

 programs.i3status = {
   enable = true;
   general = {
     colors = true;
     color_good = "#98971a";
     color_bad  = "#9d0006";
     interval = 1;
   };
 };

      Adding various modules:

 modules = {
   "disk /" = {
      enable = true;
      position = 1;
      settings = {
        format = "FREE: %free";
      };
   /* Put some of the modules below after this comment */
   };

      Current wireless connection (ethernet is pretty much the same)

 "wireless <replace-with-interface-name>" = {
   enable = true;
   position = 2;
   settings = {
     format_up = "W: (%quality at %essid) %ip";
     format_down = "W: down";
   };
 };

      Battery status

 "battery 0" = {
   enable = true;
   position = 4;
   settings = {
     format = "BAT: %status %percentage %remaining %emptytime";
     format_down = "No battery";
     status_chr = "CHR";
     status_bat = "";
     status_unk = "?";
     status_full = "FULL";
     path = "/sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/uevent";
     low_threshold = 10;
   };
 };

  Disabling default i3status modules:

   After setting up my config, i3status showed two eth- and wifi's. To
   disable ethernet _first_ and wireless _first_ just add:

 "wireless _first_" = {
   enable = false;
 };
 "ethernet _first_" = {
   enable = false;
 };
