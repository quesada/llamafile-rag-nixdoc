   From Wikipedia:

     Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is an application layer protocol that
     facilitates communication in the form of text. The chat process works on
     a client/server networking model.

Clients

     * irssi
     * Quassel
     * Weechat with the irc plugin

Servers

     * IRCd ^[cf. 1]^[cf. 2]

Bouncers

   An IRC bouncer stays connected to IRC servers so clients can disconnect
   without missing messages or losing the session.

     * ZNC
     * keep a client open in a tmux ^[cf. 3]^[cf. 4]^[cf. 5] session

Gateways

   An IRC gateway recieves messages through other chat networks (e.g. |XMPP)
   and forwards them through IRC.
