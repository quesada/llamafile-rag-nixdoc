   From NixOS Wiki

   Immich is an open-source software, designed to provide a self-hosted
   alternative for managing and backing up photos and videos, with a focus on
   privacy and ease of use.

Setup

   Note: The module is not yet part of the latest NixOS stable release and is
   currently in a PR at https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/324127

   The following example configuration will enable Immich locally

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.immich = {
   enable = true;
   environment.IMMICH_MACHINE_LEARNING_URL = "http://localhost:3003";
 };

   After applying the configuration you can access the instance via
   http://localhost:3001.

  Hardware Accelerated Transcoding using VA-API

   First make sure you have configured hardware acceleration on your system
   as described in Accelerated Video Playback.

   To make use of hardware accelerated video transcoding using VA-API, make
   sure to add your Immich user to the render and video groups. If you are
   using the default immich user, you can use the following snippet to enable
   VA-API support.

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 users.users.immich.extraGroups = [ "video" "render" ];
