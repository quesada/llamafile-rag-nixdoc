   This guide explains how to install NixOS on Kimsufi machines from the
   rescue system. It is based on this blog post (with permission) and
   includes some minor corrections & simplifications. All thanks to Michael
   Maclean & Graham Christensen for the original post.

How-to

   Set your machine to netboot into the rescue system using the Kimsufi
   control panel, and reboot it. You’ll get a password for the root user via
   email. The rescue system starts the machine up using a Linux distro
   provided over a read-only NFS, and a home directory which is in a tmpfs in
   memory. We’ll use this space to install the Nix tools later on. We’re
   logged in as root which gives us a fair amount of flexibility. The
   machine’s own hard disk is not mounted by default–we’ll do this after
   partitioning.

   The first steps are to log in via SSH, and flatten the disk, then set up
   the partition layout.

  Partitioning and formatting

   I created a 512MB partition for /boot, then most of the disk is taken up
   by the root partition (btrfs in this instance, but choose your own poison;
   also see original post for ZFS setup), and the final 4GB is swap.

   I’m going to present all these commands as if it were a script, but I did
   it all interactively.

 wipefs -a /dev/sda

 parted /dev/sda -- mklabel msdos
 parted /dev/sda -- mkpart primary 1MiB 512MiB # /dev/sda1 is /boot
 parted /dev/sda -- mkpart primary 512MiB -8GiB # This is the root partition
 parted /dev/sda -- mkpart primary linux-swap -8GiB 100% # Swap

 mkfs.ext4 -L boot /dev/sda1
 mkfs.btrfs -L nixos /dev/sda2
 mkswap -L swap /dev/sda3

 mount /dev/disk/by-label/root /mnt
 mkdir /mnt/boot
 mount /dev/disk/by-label/boot /mnt/boot

   Now the partition layout is complete. We can move on to the NixOS parts.

  Getting Nix

   We need an existing installation of Nix for `nixos-install`. There are
   some prerequisites needed before we can install & use Nix in the rescue
   system.

 # Create a user for the install process
 useradd -m setupuser

 # Create a user for the Nix daemon
 groupadd -g 30000 nixbld
 useradd -u 30000 -g nixbld -G nixbld nixbld

 # Set this to something you will remember, you'll need it in a moment
 passwd setupuser

 # Give sudo rights to your user
 echo "setupuser    ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >/etc/sudoers.d/setupuser
 su setupuser -s /bin/bash -l

 # Disable sandboxing as it doesn't work in tmpfs mounted systems
 # see: https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/5934
 sudo mkdir -p /etc/nix/
 echo "sandbox = false" | sudo tee -a /etc/nix/nix.conf

  # Install Nix
 curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh

 # This next line makes the Nix tools available in our shell
 source $HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh

 # The default channel is `nixpkgs-unstable`, let's switch to a stable NixOS channel
 nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixos-22.11 nixpkgs
 nix-channel --update

 nix-shell -p nixos-install-tools
 sudo `which nixos-generate-config` --root /mnt

   This will place the usual configuration in
   /mnt/etc/nixos/configuration.nix and
   /mnt/etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix. I only changed the former file.
   I’m not going to paste the entire config in here, but I will call out the
   key parts that were needed for this to work.

 # This machine is very insistent on BIOS boot, so configure that
 boot.loader.grub.enable = true;
 boot.loader.grub.version = 2;
 boot.loader.grub.device = "/dev/sda"; # or "nodev" for efi only

 networking.hostName = "metis";

 # Check what the rescue system's IP, route and optionally nameservers are
 # (or just use 8.8.8.8 for DNS if you like)

 networking.usePredictableInterfaceNames = false;
 networking.interfaces.eth0.ipv4.addresses = [{
     address = "192.0.2.1";
     prefixLength = 24;
 }];

 networking.defaultGateway = "192.0.2.254";
 networking.nameservers = [ "8.8.8.8" ];

 services.openssh.enable = true;

 # You can enable this once you've proved the machine boots
 networking.firewall.enable = false;

 users.users = {
     # Usual user config goes here. Be sure to include an SSH public key for root
     # (`users.users.root.openssh.authorizedKeys.keys`; password login per SSH is disabled
     # by default for root) or some other way to log in & get root, e.g. a user in group `wheel`
     # with a hashed password (an SSH public key alone won't help you with `sudo`!).
 }

  Installing NixOS

 sudo PATH="$PATH" NIX_PATH="${NIX_PATH:-$HOME/.nix-defexpr/channels}" `which nixos-install` --root /mnt

   If all goes well, you should be asked to set a root password. You may
   encounter quite a lot of errors about locales being missing–I ignored
   these as they didn’t seem to matter.

   At this point, you should have a NixOS system ready to go on the machine’s
   internal disk. You’ll need to use the Kimsufi control panel to set the
   machine back to boot from its own hard disk, using the menu option marked
   Netboot.

   You will probably encounter an error when you connect because the SSH host
   key will have changed. You can fix this with ssh-keygen -R 192.0.2.1
   (replacing the IP with the one for your machine), and then try again.
   Hopefully you’ve now got a new NixOS machine up and running and ready to
   do whatever you need it to do.
