   1st class NixOS support      
                                Start a NixOS server with a single command   
   GandiCloud VPS               or by few clicks in the web UI: it is a      
                                provided and supported server image.         
                                When ordering or configuring, the "Manual    
   VPS2day                      Install (Advanced)" option includes NixOS.   
                                Installation is done through a web-based     
                                console.                                     
                                A non-profit association providing free as   
                                in freedom VPS services for its members.     
                                NixOS is available in the registration form  
   vpsFree.cz                   and administration interface. See NixOS at   
                                kb.vpsfree.org for more information. See     
                                nixops example on howto setup a server using 
                                nix 2.7 and nixops 2.0.                      
                                South African Hosting Provider offering      
   Rackzar.com                  NixOS on all VPS plans as a drop down OS     
                                during checkout.                             
   Support NixOS via custom ISO 
                                BuyVM no longer provides first party support 
                                for NixOS. You can install NixOS using the   
   BuyVM                        custom ISO functionality, however the        
                                resulting install will need some form of     
                                static IP configuration.                     
                                From Hetzner's rescue image one can boot     
                                into the nixos installer using a custom      
                                kexec image. The installation can be fully   
                                automated using nixos-anywhere. Hetzner also 
                                provides an interface to upload your own     
   Hetzner Online               ISO-images. Also here you may want to build  
                                your own iso-image, which has openssh with   
                                ssh keys due the lack of a remote console.   
                                An easier method to install NixOS on         
                                Hetzner, is to use the existing integration  
                                into NixOps. Also see Install NixOS on       
                                Hetzner Online for future information        
                                Hetzner Cloud has NixOS ISO images that can  
                                be mounted on a running instance.            
                                                                             
                                When creating the VM, you have to choose a   
                                different initial distribution and than      
   Hetzner Cloud                select the NixOS under "ISO images" in the   
                                VM instance page to reboot into the NixOS    
                                installer. An alternative approach is using  
                                nixos-anywhere than can also use other Linux 
                                distributions as a base and convert them     
                                into NixOS installation. See also Install    
                                NixOS on Hetzner Cloud.

                                create a bios-boot partition for grub.       
                                A NixOS ISO can be use with iDrac (Dell) or  
                                iLo (HP). You can upload your own iso or use 
   Online                       virtualmedia. You must have a Dell or HP     
                                server. Here is the documentation if you     
                                don't know DRAC at Online.

                                request their helpful support team to mount  
                                a specific ISO image. Using the graphical    
                                installation works best as you will need to  
                                set the static ip address, gateway and       
                                nameserver as provided to gain internet      
   Cloud.co.za                  access. During the installation setup and    
                                you will configure your login to be          
                                password-less in order to access the server  
                                via the VNC console. On the first boot, to   
                                complete the configuration for the           
                                networking (hostname, static ip, gateway,    
                                nameservers, etc), the ssh access for your   
                                user and lastly remove the password-less     
                                login.

                                used to transform an existing Ubuntu 16.04   
   Genesis Cloud                installation into NixOS. This process can be 
                                fully automated (example) when using the API 
                                by supplying the unmount and nixos-infect    
                                commands in a custom startup_script.

                                The kexec method (see Install NixOS on       
                                Scaleway X86 Virtual Cloud Server) works     
                                well, but bear in mind it only works with    
                                the 'virtual' class of servers, as they run  
                                under a hypervisor which attaches the disks  
   Scaleway                     before the kernel boots. The 'bare-metal'    
                                servers rely on a special Linux kernel       
                                booting to attach network /dev/nbdX drives   
                                which works only with Scaleway supplied      
                                images. There is a image proposal to add     
                                full NixOS support.                          

Hoster-agnostic means of installation

   This section links to or explains methods that can be used on various
   providers. As always, with unsupported hosts and unsupported
   distributions, your mileage may vary.

   Not all providers allow to upload custom images or provide NixOS images
   for installation. However there are a few ways to install NixOS anyhow.
   nixos-in-place and nixos-infect are generic approaches to install NixOS
   from an existing Linux. Another approach is to use a kexec-based image as
   is done with nixos-anywhere. This also allows for changing the underlying
   filesystem. See Install NixOS on a Server With a Different Filesystem.

   See also the NixOps project, which also provides interfaces to different
   cloud providers.
