Why?

   For 'normal' NixOS installations, you'd use the instructions from
   https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-installation

   However, you can install 'directly from Linux' if:

     * You already have a running linux distro
     * You don't want to waste a CD-R (and can't boot from USB)
     * You have a spare partition where to install NixOS ready.

   One method is described in the manual at
   https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#sec-installing-from-other-distro.
   For an alternative method, see below.

How?

   To simplify, we will be using these abbreviations:

   /dev/sda1
           your boot partition, containing already working grub

   /dev/sda2
           your linux root partition, containing your currently working OS
           (/dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 *can* be the same partition!)

   /dev/sda3
           your spare partition to where you will install NixOS

   /boot
           the boot directory, where grub is installed

   ~/inst
           directory where the ISO is (loop) mounted

   The following sections outline two installation methods. Choose the one
   that suits you best.

Installing through a chroot

   In this section we will install NixOS by unpacking the ISO and then
   chrooting into its contents to start the final install.

   Note that this may not work on all distributions (eg. older versions of
   debian stable).

  Preparations

   Get a NixOS ISO and unpack the squashfs filesystem containing the nix
   store. A tool from squashfs-tools is required, so install that package
   first.

   The following commands create two directories in your home directory, one
   for the ISO mountpoint and one for the host system. Then the ISO is
   downloaded (substitute as you please), mounted and the nix store
   extracted.

 # cd ~
 # mkdir -p inst host/nix
 # wget https://channels.nixos.org/nixos-21.11/latest-nixos-minimal-x86_64-linux.iso
 # modprobe loop
 # mount -o loop latest-nixos-minimal-x86_64-linux.iso inst
 # unsquashfs -d host/nix/store inst/nix-store.squashfs '*'

   To have a working network connection, copy /etc/resolv.conf to
   host/nix/etc. For a working chroot, you also need to bind /dev, /proc and
   /sys directories to the target system.

 # cd host
 # mkdir -p etc dev proc sys
 # cp /etc/resolv.conf etc
 # for fn in dev proc sys; do mount --bind "/${fn}" "${fn}"; done

  Circumventing regular init sequence

   To properly chroot into the host system you must locate the packages named
   nixos and bash. The following commands may prove helpful:

 # INIT=$(find . -type f -path '*nixos*/init')
 # echo $INIT
 ./nix/store/abwlkvzyjd2i39b1l1wfv7v9ilx88fwi-nixos-0.1pre34067-34077/init
 # BASH=$(find . -type f -path '*/bin/bash' | tail -n 1)
 # echo $BASH
 ./nix/store/bmgq2jrn6719r6j55gs4rzfp0azcbazy-bash-4.2-p24/bin/bash

   Replace further mentions of these files with your own results! Note the
   missing prefix in some uses.

   Next we have to edit the target system init script to start a bash session
   instead of systemd. As that is the last thing the script does, adding an
   interactive program does not pose a problem.

 # sed -i "s,exec /.*systemd,exec /$BASH," $INIT

  Starting the install

   Now we are able to chroot into the NixOS system used for installation. You
   may get several warnings and errors, but you can safely ignore them unless
   they are fatal. If you're installing from Arch, you may need to remove the
   mount call that tries to make / private in the same init script.

   Using chroot:

 # chroot . /$INIT

   Using pivot_root:

 # mkdir old_root
 # mount --make-rprivate /
 # pivot_root . old_root
 # $INIT

   Further commands to be executed in the chrooted environment will be
   prefixed with "# (chroot)".

   The next steps are the same as with classical installation methods. Create
   a suitable NixOS configuration and start the build.

 # (chroot) mount /dev/sda3 /mnt
 # (chroot) nixos-generate-config --root /mnt
 # (chroot) nano /mnt/etc/nixos/configuration.nix

   Before executing nixos-install you might want to run nixos-checkout to
   obtain the most recent version of packages to be installed into your NixOS
   system. You might need to copy /etc/resolv.conf from the host to the
   target system.

 # (chroot) NIX_PATH="nixpkgs=channel:nixos-21.11" nixos-install

   Now your system should be set up. Be sure to change the root password to
   be able to login and double check that /mnt/boot/grub/menu.lst is present
   and looks sensible.

 # (chroot) passwd

   Finally, if you instructed nix not to overwrite your existing boot loader,
   manually copy the menu.lst entries into your existing system's GRUB
   menu.lst.

   Once you're done tweaking, exit the chroot (exit or ctrl-d will) and
   reboot. With any luck, you will have new choices in the GRUB menu to
   choose from.

Running the LiveCD installer from disk

   In this section we will install NixOS by transfering the installer from
   the ISO to a bootable partition and then running it.

   WARNING

   This approach relies on merging the LiveCD image with the contents of your
   working partition, so several limitations apply:

     * the target partition needs to have enough free space for both the
       working partition (/dev/sda2) and the uncompressed nix store from the
       LiveCD
     * /etc will be merged, so your current settings can interfere with the
       final installation steps

  Unpacking the ISO image

 # wget https://channels.nixos.org/nixos-24.05/latest-nixos-minimal-x86_64-linux.iso # get the latest iso (URL might change!)
 # modprobe loop
 # mount -o loop latest-nixos-minimal-x86_64-linux.iso ~/inst
 # # mount /dev/sda1 # mount the /boot partition if you have it
 # cp ~/inst/boot/bzImage /boot/nixos-livecd-bzImage
 # cp ~/inst/boot/initrd /boot/nixos-livecd-initrd
 # cp ~/inst/nix-store.squashfs /nix-store.squashfs

  Modifying your bootloader's config

   Look at some_dir/boot/grub/grub.cfg. This is Grub-2 main config file of
   the ISO. Locate the NixOS menuentry section:

 menuentry "NixOS Installer / Rescue" {
   linux /boot/bzImage init=/nix/store/p5n72ay1c1wx4wry90zabr8jnljpdzgx-nixos-0.2pre4601_1def5ba-48a4e91/init root=LABEL=NIXOS_0.2pre4601_1def5ba-48a4e91
   initrd /boot/initrd
 }

   The goal is to tell your bootloader to boot /nixos-livecd-bzImage with
   correct init argument.

    GRUB 1

   To setup grub-1, edit your /boot/grub/menu.lst (or equivalent). Add
   following lines to the config:

 title NixOS LiveCD
 kernel /nixos-livecd-bzImage init=/nix/store/p5n72ay1c1wx4wry90zabr8jnljpdzgx-nixos-0.2pre4601_1def5ba-48a4e91/init root=/dev/sda2 splash=verbose vga=0x317
 initrd /nixos-livecd-initrd

   Note, that hash should match with what you have seen in
   some_dir/grub/grub.cfg

   Go to the reboot section

    GRUB 2

   A grub entry for ubuntu might look like this:

 menuentry "NixOS Installer / Rescue" {
   linux /nixos-livecd-bzImage init=/nix/store/p5n72ay1c1wx4wry90zabr8jnljpdzgx-nixos-0.2pre4601_1def5ba-48a4e91/init root=/dev/sda2
   initrd /nixos-lived-initrd
 }

    Other bootloaders

   Should also work. Please add instructions here.

  Booting into LiveCD

   Reboot. Select "NixOS LiveCD" from the bootloader menu. If everything is
   OK, you will see Login prompt asking you to login as root with empty
   password. DO NOT TRUST IT BLINDLY. You probably have your /etc mounted
   from /dev/sda2 so it contains your old passwd (as well as LiveCD stuff
   merged into by the means of UnionFS). So if empty password is not working,
   try your old root password.

   Thats it. Now follow the manual (Alt-F8), mount /dev/sda3 as /mnt, do
   nixos-option and so on.
