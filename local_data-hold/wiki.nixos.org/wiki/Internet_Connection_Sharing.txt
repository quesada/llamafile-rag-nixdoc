   The following example will describe how to share an active internet
   connection over a WiFi hotspot or alternatively via ethernet.

Share via WiFi

  Usage

   Share an existing internet connection of a wired interface eth0 using a
   wifi hotspot on wlan0 with the access point name MyAccessPoint.

 nix shell nixpkgs#linux-wifi-hotspot
 sudo create_ap wlan0 eth0 MyAccessPoint

   Here eth0 is the ethernet interface connected to the internet, and wlan0
   is the wifi interface to share the internet connection with a wifi
   hotspot. However, these names may not be the same on your system. To check
   the name of your hardware interface use the command ifconfig or ifconfig |
   grep ^[^:]*: It will list network adapters on your system. Then modify
   command accordingly sudo create_ap <wifiInterfaceName>
   <ethernetInterfaceName> MyAccessPoint <Password>

  Configuration

   Persistently share an existing internet connection of a wired interface
   eth0 using a wifi hotspot on wlan0 with the access point name My Wifi
   Hotspot. The network is protected with a simple WPA2 pre-shared key
   12345678.

 services.create_ap = {
   enable = true;
   settings = {
     INTERNET_IFACE = "eth0";
     WIFI_IFACE = "wlan0";
     SSID = "My Wifi Hotspot";
     PASSPHRASE = "12345678";
   };
 };

Share via ethernet

  Usage

   Share an existing internet connection of a wireless interface wlan0 to
   clients connected on a ethernet device eth0. Make sure you've got TCP and
   UDP port 53 for the dnsmasq DHCP server opened in your Firewall.

 # Setup ethernet device
 ip link set up eth0
 ip addr add 10.0.0.1/24 dev eth0

 # Enable packet forwarding
 sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

 # Enable NAT for leaving packets
 nft add rule nat POSTROUTING oifname wlan0 masquerade

 # Start dnsmasq for DHCP
 dnsmasq -d -i eth0 --dhcp-range=10.0.0.2,10.0.0.255,255.255.255.0,24h

   To cleanup the configured interface run following commands

 ip addr del 10.0.0.1/24 dev eth0
 ip link set down eth0
 # Get handle_number with: nft -a list table nat
 nft delete rule nat POSTROUTING handle <handle_number>

  Configuration

   Persistently share an existing internet connection on interface `wlan0` to
   clients connected on an ethernet interface `eth0`. Tested where `wlan0` is
   a wireless interface, but it should work with a different ethernet
   interface as well. You do not need to manually open port 53.

 # Set a static IP on the "downstream" interface
 networking.interfaces."eth0" = {
   useDHCP = false;
   ipv4.addresses = [{
     address = "10.0.0.1";
     prefixLength = 24;
   }];
 };
 networking.firewall.extraCommands = ''
   # Set up SNAT on packets going from downstream to the wider internet
   iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE

   # Accept all connections from downstream. May not be necessary
   iptables -A INPUT -i enp2s0 -j ACCEPT
 '';
 # Run a DHCP server on the downstream interface
 services.kea.dhcp4 = {
   enable = true;
   settings = {
     interfaces-config = {
       interfaces = [
         "eth0"
       ];
     };
     lease-database = {
       name = "/var/lib/kea/dhcp4.leases";
       persist = true;
       type = "memfile";
     };
     rebind-timer = 2000;
     renew-timer = 1000;
     subnet4 = [
       {
         id = 1;
         pools = [
           {
             pool = "10.0.0.2 - 10.0.0.255";
           }
         ];
         subnet = "10.0.0.1/24";
       }
     ];
     valid-lifetime = 4000;
     option-data = [{
       name = "routers";
       data = "10.0.0.1";
     }];
   };
 };
