   iwd (iNet wireless daemon) is a Linux-only wireless daemon aiming to
   decrease the time spent making connections.

Installation

   iwd can be enabled with the following snippet.

 networking.wireless.iwd.enable = true;

Usage

   Connections can be managed using the provided iwctl tool.

Configuration

   To configure iwd, you should use networking.wireless.iwd.settings option.
   An example configuration, which enables IPv6 and automatic connection to
   known networks, would be similar to:

 {
   networking.wireless.iwd.settings = {
     IPv6 = {
       Enabled = true;
     };
     Settings = {
       AutoConnect = true;
     };
   };
 }

   For a detailed and up-to-date list of available settings, please reference
   the network daemon configuration docummentation, from kernel Git repo.

  iwd as backend for NetworkManager

   If iwd is present, it can be used as a backend for NetworkManager through
   the following snippet.

 networking.networkmanager.wifi.backend = "iwd";

  iwd as backend for Connman

   Iwd could be use as a backend for Connman too.

 services.connman.wifi.backend = "iwd";

   Note that iwd is experimental and it does not have feature parity with the
   default backend, wpa_supplicant.

Troubleshooting

  org.freedesktop.service failed

   When connecting to a protected network it could happen that no password
   window appears and the following message is written in the journal:

 dbus-daemon[1732]: [session uid=9001 pid=1730] Activated service 'org.freedesktop.secrets' failed: Failed to execute program org.freedesktop.secrets: No such file or directory

   Your desktop manager may not enable some secrets management service you
   may need to enable one:

 {
   services.gnome3.gnome-keyring.enable = true;
 }

  rfkill blocks wireless device

   If the wi-fi connection is blocked by rf-kill, it it is needed to unblock
   the the wireless device. A way to do that with Nix is by using
   system.activationScripts.

 {
   system.activationScripts = {
     rfkillUnblockWlan = {
       text = ''
       rfkill unblock wlan
       '';
       deps = [];
     };
   };
 }
