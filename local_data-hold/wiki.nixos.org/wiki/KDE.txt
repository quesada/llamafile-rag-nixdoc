   From NixOS Wiki

   KDE Plasma is a desktop environment that aims to be simple by default,
   powerful when needed.

Installation

  Plasma 6

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 {
   services.xserver.enable = true; # optional
   services.displayManager.sddm.enable = true;
   services.displayManager.sddm.wayland.enable = true;
   services.desktopManager.plasma6.enable = true;
 }

  Plasma 5

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 {
   services.xserver.enable = true;
   services.displayManager.sddm.enable = true;
   services.xserver.desktopManager.plasma5.enable = true;
 }

Configuration

  Rootless X11

   sddm launches X11 as a root user by default. For better security, X11 can
   be run as a non-root user, but using Wayland is better tested and thus
   preferred:

 services.xserver.displayManager.sddm.settings.General.DisplayServer = "x11-user";

  Excluding applications from the default install

   Some optional packages can be excluded if they are not needed at the cost
   of functionality.

    Plasma 6

   Optional packages: plasma6.nix

 environment.plasma6.excludePackages = with pkgs.kdePackages; [
   plasma-browser-integration
   konsole
   elisa
 ];

    Plasma 5

   Optional packages: plasma5.nix

 environment.plasma5.excludePackages = with pkgs.libsForQt5; [
   plasma-browser-integration
   konsole
   oxygen
 ];

  GNOME desktop integration

   Using the following example configuration, QT applications will have a
   look similar to the GNOME desktop, using a dark theme.

 qt = {
   enable = true;
   platformTheme = "gnome";
   style.name = "adwaita-dark";
 };

   For other themes, you may need the packages libsForQt5.qt5ct and
   libsForQt5.qtstyleplugin-kvantum and a symlink from ~/.config/Kvantum/ to
   your theme package. Here is an example using Arc-Dark and Home Manager. In
   the Home Manager configuration:

 qt = {
   enable = true;
   platformTheme = "qtct";
   style.name = "kvantum";
 };

 xdg.configFile = {
   "Kvantum/ArcDark".source = "${pkgs.arc-kde-theme}/share/Kvantum/ArcDark";
   "Kvantum/kvantum.kvconfig".text = "[General]\ntheme=ArcDark";
 };

   For more details, see this forum post.

  Default Wayland/X11 session

    Plasma 6

   Plasma 6 runs on Wayland by default. To launch an X11 session by default:

 services.xserver.displayManager.defaultSession = "plasmax11";

    SDDM on Wayland

 services.xserver.displayManager.sddm.wayland.enable = true;

    Plasma 5

   Plasma 5 runs on X11 by default and it is recommended to use Wayland with
   Plasma 6 instead. To launch a Wayland session by default anyway:

 services.xserver.displayManager.defaultSession = "plasmawayland";

Troubleshooting

  Qt/KDE applications segfault on start

   This is caused by a stale QML cache (see this issue). A dirty way to fix
   this is by running on a terminal the following command:

 find ${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/**/qmlcache -type f -delete

  GTK themes are not applied in Wayland applications / Window Decorations
  missing / Cursor looks different

   This affects GTK applications including Firefox and Thunderbird.

   You may need to set a GTK theme Breeze imitating the KDE theme with the
   same name in System Settings -> Application Style -->Configure GNOME/GTK
   Application Style.

   (See this issue)

Tips and tricks

  Plasma-Manager

   Note: Plasma-Manager is an unofficial community project and is not yet
   mature

   By default, the Plasma configuration can be handled like on traditional
   systems. With plasma-manager, it is possible to make Plasma configurations
   via nix by providing home-manager modules.

  User icon (avatar)

   You can add a profile picture to your user by using a png file in
   ~/.face.icon.
