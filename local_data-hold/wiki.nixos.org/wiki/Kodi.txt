   From NixOS Wiki

   Kodi (formerly known as XBMC) is an award-winning free and open source
   (GPL) software media player and entertainment hub that can be installed on
   Linux, OSX, Windows, iOS and Android, featuring a 10-foot user interface
   for use with televisions and remote controls.

Basic module usage

   The NixOS module for Kodi sets Kodi up as a desktop session. With this
   configuration Kodi will run automatically on boot:

 {
   services.xserver.enable = true;
   services.xserver.desktopManager.kodi.enable = true;
   services.xserver.displayManager.autoLogin.enable = true;
   services.xserver.displayManager.autoLogin.user = "kodi";

   services.xserver.displayManager.lightdm.greeter.enable = false;

   # Define a user account
   users.extraUsers.kodi.isNormalUser = true;
 }

Access from other machines

   For this to work Kodi's remote interface must be enabled in the Kodi
   configuration. Kodi uses by default udp/tcp port 8080, which must be
   allowed in the firewall:

 {
   networking.firewall = {
     allowedTCPPorts = [ 8080 ];
     allowedUDPPorts = [ 8080 ];
   };
 }

With Wayland

   Especially on less-powerful ARM boards the wayland variant is faster. In
   this example cage, kiosk compositor for Wayland, will run Kodi as its only
   application:

 { pkgs, ... }: {
   # Define a user account
   users.extraUsers.kodi.isNormalUser = true;
   services.cage.user = "kodi";
   services.cage.program = "${pkgs.kodi-wayland}/bin/kodi-standalone";
   services.cage.enable = true;
 }

Plugins

   There are two different ways to install plugins. You can either set the
   relevant option (search pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix for "wrapKodi" for
   a list) through NixOS or home-manager:

 nixpkgs.config.kodi.enableAdvancedLauncher = true;

   or override Kodi to include the plugins (see
   pkgs/applications/video/kodi/plugins.nix for a list or search in the
   kodiPlugins namespace):

 environment.systemPackages = [
         (pkgs.kodi.withPackages (kodiPkgs: with kodiPkgs; [
                 jellyfin
         ]))
 ];

   Or if using as the startup desktop service:

   services.xserver.desktopManager.kodi.package =
     pkgs.kodi.withPackages (pkgs: with pkgs; [
     jellycon
         ]))
 ];
