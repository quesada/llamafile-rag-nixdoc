   Konqueror is a file manager application preinstalled in KDE/Plasma Desktop
   Environments.

Running without KDE

   Since NixOS makes it easy to run individual KDE applications without
   running the KDE Plasma desktop manager, one can easily install Konqueror
   as a file manager; but (as of NixOS Stable 22.11) it won't show thumbnails
   (which it calls "preview icons").

   The fix (again, as of NixOS Stable 22.11) seems to be to install these
   packages in environment.systemPackages, in addition to
   libsForQt5.konqueror:

     * ffmpegthumbnailer
     * libsForQt5.kdegraphics-thumbnailers
     * libsForQt5.ffmpegthumbs
     * libsForQt5.kio-extras
