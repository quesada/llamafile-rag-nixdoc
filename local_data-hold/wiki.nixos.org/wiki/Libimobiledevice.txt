   The libimobiledevice project provides libraries and tools to connect and
   transfer data between iOS devices and Linux machines.

Usage

  Preparation

   In order to be able to automatically mount your iOS device (such as an
   iPhone) when connecting it or to enable USB tethering, you need to install
   libimobiledevice and to activate the usbmuxd service.

   Add the following to your configuration.nix:

 services.usbmuxd.enable = true;

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
   libimobiledevice
   ifuse # optional, to mount using 'ifuse'
 ];

   If you experience issues mounting or pairing your device (for example as
   described here), you can try to switch the usbmuxd daemon package to an
   alternative more updated implementation, usbmuxd2.

 services.usbmuxd = {
   enable = true;
   package = pkgs.usbmuxd2;
 };

  Mounting

   Mounting the device via iFuse is possible with the following commands

 $ mkdir /tmp/iphone
 $ ifuse /tmp/iphone

  Tethering

   Tethering on iOS is possible via Wifi hotspot, Bluetooth or USB. In order
   to enable USB tethering, first enable tethering in the iOS networking
   settings. After that run following command

 $ idevicepair pair

   Confirm pairing by accepting the connection on your iOS device. After that
   an ethernet device will appear in your network device list.

Maintenance

  Factory reset

   The following section describes how to perform a hard/factory reset and
   reinstalling the latest firmware. First install and enable the required
   daemon and package.

 services.usbmuxd.enable = true;
 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
   idevicerestore
 ];

   Shutdown your iDevice and put it into DFU/recovery mode. How to achieve
   this depends on your iDevice model. See DFU Mode on the iPhone Wiki for
   more details.

   Once your iDevice is in recovery mode, run following command to reset your
   device. You will get asked which firmware to install and a final
   confirmation that everything will be erased.

   Warning: The following command will reset your iPhone. All user data will
   be lost. Be sure to backup everything before proceeding.

 # sudo idevicerestore --erase --latest
