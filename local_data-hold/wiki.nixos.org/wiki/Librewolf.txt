   From NixOS Wiki

   LibreWolf is a web browser and fork of Firefox with an emphasis on privacy
   and security. It is a custom and independent version of Firefox that aims
   to increase protection against tracking and fingerprinting techniques,
   while also removing all the telemetry, data collection and annoyances.

Installation

   To install LibreWolf system wide add the following line to your system
   configuration

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.librewolf ];

Configuration

   It is possible to configure certain presets of LibreWolf using the Home
   Manager module.

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 home-manager.users.myuser = {
   programs.librewolf = {
     enable = true;
     # Enable WebGL, cookies and history
     settings = {
       "webgl.disabled" = false;
       "privacy.resistFingerprinting" = false;
       "privacy.clearOnShutdown.history" = false;
       "privacy.clearOnShutdown.cookies" = false;
       "network.cookie.lifetimePolicy" = 0;
     };
   };
 };

   This example configures LibreWolf to enable WebGL, remember cookies and
   history by disabling privacy and security defaults. This compromises the
   privacy concept of LibreWolf and is therefore not recommended to use.
