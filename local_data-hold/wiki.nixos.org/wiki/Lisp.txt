About

   Lisp is a family of typically interpreted functional languages with
   dynamic, minimal typing, and many parantheses.

Common Lisp

   The modern implementation is sbcl. Nix can be used for library management
   with sbclPackages. External package management can be used with caution.

  Editor integration

    Emacs

   See emacs.

    VS Code

   The Alive extension for VS Code can be used. Be careful to follow the
   instructions described on the marketplace. Refer to the Lisp section of
   the NixOS manual to start with quicklisp. VS Code can be launched from a
   Nix shell with required packages available but this may cause stability
   issues.

Scheme
