#! nix-shell with lua interpreter

   To use a nix-shell shebang with lua you will need to use following
   structure:

 #!/usr/bin/env nix-shell
 --[[
 #!nix-shell -i lua -p lua
 ]]

 print("this is from lua")

   Some background by samueldr^[1]:

     Two inter-twined fun facts.

       * Lua only skips one shebang line.
       * nix-shell doesn't require its magic lines to be right after the
         first line.
