   From NixOS Wiki

   Man pages are a form of documentation available on Unix-like systems.

   See the Archwiki and Wikipedia entries for more information.

NixOS: Display configuration options

   The NixOS option system creates a manpage with all options and their
   documentation.

 $ man 5 configuration.nix

   This is a lightweight alternative to the “Configuration Options” page in
   nixos-help. There is also NixOS options website

NixOS: Some man pages are missing

  Development man pages

   The “Linux man-pages project” provides a set of documentation of the Linux
   programming API, mostly section `3`. You can access them by adding them to
   your system packages:

 environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.man-pages pkgs.man-pages-posix ];

   To try it out: man 3 scanf.

   Libraries and development utilities might provide additional documentation
   and manpages. You can add those to your system like this:

 documentation.dev.enable = true;

   See also: the other options in the `documentation` namespace.

Mandoc as the default man page viewer

   Mandoc is a set of tools designed for working with mdoc(7), the preferred
   roff macro language for BSD manual pages, as well as man(7), the
   historical roff macro language used in UNIX manuals. It can be used as an
   alternative to man-db.

   To use mandoc as the default man page viewer add following code to your
   config:

 documentation.man = {
   # In order to enable to mandoc man-db has to be disabled.
   man-db.enable = false;
   mandoc.enable = true;
 };

   See also: the Mandoc website.
