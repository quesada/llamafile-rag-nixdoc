   From NixOS Wiki
   ✦
   Editors are generally expected to adhere to this standard, applying common
   sense and allowing for occasional exceptions. Significant edits to this
   page should reflect a consensus. If uncertain, please discuss on the talk
   page first.

   This Manual of Style (hereinafter referred to as "MoS" or "MOS") is
   designed to ensure that all content on the NixOS Wiki is presented in a
   clear and consistent manner. It provides guidelines on language usage,
   article structure, formatting, and other stylistic elements to maintain a
   high standard of quality across the wiki. This guide is intended for all
   contributors, whether they are new to editing or have extensive
   experience, to assist them in creating content that is both informative
   and accessible.

   Technical writing is a skill that gets better with practice. This Manual
   of Style will help editors do that. It's OK to try to stick to it for the
   most part at first. A wiki thrives on all users helping each other to
   create better content.

   Editors should compose articles using language that is clear, concise, and
   readily comprehensible. Articles must be organized with consistent,
   reader-friendly layouts and formatting, as delineated in this guide.

   Any new content incorporated into this page must directly address a
   persistently recurring style issue.

Rules of thumb

       the wiki.
     * Cite reliable sources: Aim to ensure that all information added is
       verifiable and comes from reliable sources.
     * Maintain neutrality: Strive to present information in a neutral and
       unbiased manner.
     * Be clear and concise: Use clear, concise, and grammatically correct
       language to ensure readability and understanding.
     * Follow site guidelines: Adhere to the site's guidelines and policies
       at all times.

       are still learning the ropes.
     * Respect others: Treat all users with respect and courtesy. Personal
       attacks and harassment are strictly prohibited.
     * No advertising, vandalism, or spamming: Contributions should be

Content policy

  Plagiarizing

   Plagiarizing involves using someone else’s work without proper attribution
   and presenting it as your own. This practice is strictly prohibited on
   this wiki.

     * Definition: Plagiarism includes copying text, images, or other media
       without crediting the original source.
     * Consequences: Plagiarized content will be removed immediately.
       Contributors who repeatedly plagiarize may be banned.
     * Prevention: Always cite your sources. Use quotation marks for direct
       quotes and provide proper references. Don't just copy&paste a single
       sentence, but change it at least a little.

  Vandalism

   Vandalism refers to any act of deliberately adding false or misleading
   information, deleting content, or otherwise compromising the integrity of
   the wiki.

     * Types of vandalism: This includes adding false information, deleting
       pages, inserting inappropriate content, and spamming links.
     * Response: Vandalized pages will be promptly reverted to their previous
       state. Persistent vandals will be blocked from editing.
     * Reporting: Users are encouraged to report vandalism immediately.

  Spam and advertisement

   Spamming and advertising are prohibited to keep the wiki free from clutter
   and irrelevant content.

     * Definition: Spam includes repetitive content, irrelevant links, and
       advertisements for external products or services.
     * Detection: Automated filters and manual reviews help identify and
       remove spam.
     * Action: Spammers will have their content removed and may be banned
       from editing. Legitimate contributions should not include promotional
       content.

  Unofficial wikis

   Hostility towards other wikis is not tolerated. Editors who make hostile
   comments about other wikis will be warned and may be blocked.

     * Linking to other wikis: Linking to other wikis is not prohibited if
       such links contribute to the quality of the content.
     * Contribution recommendation: It is recommended that editors only
       contribute to one wiki at a time to ensure they do not inadvertently
       violate the copyright policies of the wikis they edit.

Article titles, headings, and sections

   Article titles and section headings should reflect the content they
   contain. Titles and section headings should be concise and precise. Titles
   should be consistent with the titles of related content.

  Article titles

   Article titles should be clear and descriptive, providing a succinct
   summary of the article's content. Avoid using jargon or overly technical
   terms unless they are widely understood within the context of the wiki.
   Titles should be formatted in sentence case with capitalizing only the
   first letter of the first word.

     * Consistency: Ensure that article titles are consistent with the titles
       of related content to maintain a cohesive structure across the wiki.
     * Avoid redundancy: Do not include unnecessary words or phrases that do
       not add value to the title.

  Section organization

   Proper section organization is crucial for creating well-structured,
   easily navigable articles. A logical and consistent structure helps
   readers find information quickly and understand the content more
   effectively.

    Hierarchy and structure

     * Use a clear hierarchy of headings to organize content:

  * Level 2 (==) for main sections
  * Level 3 (===) for subsections
  * Level 4 (====) for sub-subsections
  * Avoid going deeper than level 4 unless absolutely necessary

     * Begin each article with an introduction (without a heading) that
       summarizes the topic.
     * Arrange sections in a logical order, typically following this pattern:

  1. Introduction (the introduction has no heading)
  2. Installation
  3. Configuration
  4. Tips and tricks
  5. Troubleshooting
  6. References

    Standard section structure (applications)

   For consistency across the wiki, use the following structure where
   applicable:

 (Introduction)

 == Installation ==
 ==== Using nix-shell ====
 ==== Using global configuration ====
 ==== Using home configuration ====

 == Configuration ==
 ==== Basic ====
 ==== Advanced ====

 == Tips and tricks ==
 ==== Location of options ====

 == Troubleshooting ==
 ==== Issue 1 ====

 == References ==

    Flexibility

   While consistency is important, remember that different topics may require
   different structures. Use your judgment to adapt the standard structure
   when necessary, always prioritizing clarity for the reader.

  Section headers

   Section headers should be concise and accurately reflect the content of
   the section. They should provide a clear indication of what the reader can
   expect to find in that section.

     * Clarity: Use clear and descriptive language for section headers. Avoid
       vague or ambiguous terms.
     * Consistency: Maintain consistency in the formatting and style of
       section headers throughout the article.

  Length restrictions

   Be mindful of length restrictions when crafting titles and section
   headings. Excessively long names can make navigation difficult and
   negatively impact readability.

     * Limit characters: Section headings should ideally remain under 40
       characters.
     * Conciseness: Strive for brevity without sacrificing clarity. Consider
       rephrasing complex ideas or breaking them down into multiple sections.

Text formatting

   Proper text formatting is essential for maintaining consistency,
   readability, and professionalism across the NixOS Wiki. This section
   outlines the guidelines for various text formatting elements to ensure a
   uniform presentation of information.

    Title of works

   When referencing titles of various works, follow these guidelines:

     * Articles, blog posts, and short stories: Use double quotation marks
          * Example: "Understanding Nix Flakes", "The NixOS installation
            guide"
     * Software names, tools, and commands: Use regular text, typically with
       initial capitalization
          * Example: Nix, NixOS, nixpkgs, nix-shell
     * Website names: Use regular text without quotes or italics
          * Example: Visit the NixOS website for more information.

   When in doubt, prioritize clarity and consistency within the article.

    Quotations

   Proper quotation formatting helps distinguish cited material from original
   content:

     * Short quotes (less than 40 words): Use double quotation marks ("") and
       incorporate into the text.
          * Example: According to the documentation, "NixOS is a Linux
            distribution built on top of the Nix Package Manager."
     * Long quotes (40 words or more): Use block quotes by indenting the
       entire quote or using the blockquote tag.
     * Quotes within quotes: Use single quotation marks (') for the inner
       quote.
          * Example: "The developer explained, 'Nix provides a purely
            functional approach to package management,' which revolutionized
            the field."
     * Citations: Always provide a source for quotations, either inline or as
       a footnote.
          * Example: "NixOS offers reproducible builds"[1].
     * Alterations and omissions: Use square brackets [] to indicate changes
       or additions to quotes, and ellipsis (...) for omissions.
          * Example: "NixOS [provides] a unique approach to ... configuration
            management."

    Capital letters

   Proper capitalization improves readability and maintains a professional
   appearance:

     * Article titles: Use sentence case, capitalizing only the first word.
          * Example: Installing NixOS on a virtual machine
     * Section headers:
          * Main sections (==): Use sentence case
          * Subsections (===, ====): Use sentence case
     * Proper nouns: Always capitalize names of specific people, places,
       organizations, and NixOS-specific components.
          * Example: Nix, NixOS, Nixpkgs, Eelco Dolstra
     * Common nouns: Do not capitalize unless they are part of an official
       name or at the beginning of a sentence.
          * Example: "Every distribution has a package manager." but "Nix
            Package Manager"
     * Acronyms and initialisms: Generally use all caps, but follow official
       styling if different.
          * Example: RAM, CPU, NixOS (not NIXOS)

    Boldface

   Use bold text sparingly to emphasize important information:

     * First mention: Bold the first occurrence of the article's main topic
       in the introduction.
          * Example: <strong>NixOS</strong> is a Linux distribution built on
            top of the Nix package manager.
     * Key terms: Use bold for important terms being defined.
          * Example: A '''derivation''' in Nix is a description of how to
            build a package.
     * User interface elements: Bold names of buttons, menu items, or other
       UI elements.
          * Example: Click the Save button to apply your changes.
     * Avoid overuse: Do not use bold for entire sentences or paragraphs, as
       this reduces its effectiveness.

    Italic

   Italic text serves several purposes in technical writing:

     * Emphasis: Use italics to stress particular words when appropriate.
          * Example: It is crucial to back up your configuration before
            making major changes.
     * Non-English words: Italicize words or phrases from languages other
       than the primary language of the article.
          * Example: In programming, we often use the term de facto to
            describe widely accepted standards.
     * Do not italicize: Proper names, technical terms after their first use,
       or entire paragraphs.

    Spacing

   Consistent spacing improves readability and maintains a clean appearance:

     * Single space after periods: Use only one space after a period at the
       end of a sentence.
     * No spaces around slashes: In constructions like "and/or" or "TCP/IP",
       do not add spaces around the slash.
     * Space after commas: Always include a space after a comma, but not
       before.
     * Lists: Add a space after the list marker (*, #) in bulleted or
       numbered lists.
     * Parentheses: No spaces inside parentheses, but do use spaces outside
       when in a sentence.
          * Example: NixOS (a Linux distribution) offers many advantages.
     * Code blocks: Use consistent indentation within code blocks for
       readability.

    Numbers and dates

   Consistent formatting of numbers and dates is crucial for clarity:

     * Numbers:
          * Spell out numbers zero through nine in prose.
          * Use numerals for 10 and above.
          * Use commas for numbers with four or more digits (e.g., 1,000,
            10,000).
          * Use dots as decimal separator (e.g. 1,000.23 )
          * For very large numbers, consider using words (e.g., 1 million
            instead of 1,000,000).
     * Percentages: Use the % symbol with numerals (e.g., 50%), but spell out
       "percent" when the number is also spelled out (e.g., five percent).
     * Dates:
          * Use the format: Month Day, Year (e.g., January 1, 2024).
          * For numeric dates, use ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g.,
            2024-01-01).
     * Time:
          * Use 24-hour clock format to avoid ambiguity (e.g., 14:30 instead
            of 2:30 PM).
          * Include the time zone when relevant (e.g., 14:30 UTC).
     * Software versions:
          * Software versions are subject to change. Only add software
            versions when required by the content.

    Abbreviations

   Proper use of abbreviations ensures clarity while maintaining brevity:

     * First use: When first using an abbreviation, write out the full term
       followed by the abbreviation in parentheses.
          * Example: The Nix Expression Language (NEL) is used to define
            packages.
     * Common abbreviations: Well-known abbreviations (e.g., RAM, CPU) don't
       need to be spelled out on first use.
     * Plurals of abbreviations: Add 's' without an apostrophe (e.g., SSDs,
       not SSD's).
     * Periods in abbreviations:
          * Generally, omit periods in abbreviations (e.g., PhD, AM/PM).
          * Use periods for lowercase abbreviations (e.g., i.e., etc.).
     * Units of measurement: Use standard abbreviations without periods
       (e.g., 5 GB, 10 MHz).

    Grammar and punctuation

   Correct grammar and punctuation are essential for clear communication:

     * Comma usage:
          * Use the Oxford comma in lists of three or more items.
     * Semicolons: Use to separate closely related independent clauses or in
       complex lists.
     * Colons: Use to introduce lists or explanations.
     * Hyphens and dashes:
          * Use hyphens (-) for compound modifiers (e.g., well-known
            package).
          * Use en dashes (–) for ranges (e.g., 5–10 minutes).
          * Use em dashes (—) for parenthetical thoughts—like this one—in
            sentences.
     * Parentheses: Use sparingly to include additional information without
       disrupting the flow of the sentence.
     * Quotation marks: Place periods and commas inside quotation marks.
       Place other punctuation outside unless it's part of the quoted
       material.
     * Active voice: Prefer active voice over passive voice for clearer, more
       direct writing.

    Wording and tone

   Maintain a consistent and appropriate tone throughout the wiki:

     * Formal but approachable: Strike a balance between professional and
       friendly.
     * Clarity: Use clear, concise language. Avoid jargon unless necessary,
       and explain technical terms.
     * Objectivity: Present information neutrally, avoiding bias or personal
       opinions.
     * Consistency: Maintain consistent terminology throughout articles and
       across the wiki.
     * International audience: Consider that readers may not be native
       English speakers. Avoid colloquialisms or culture-specific references.
     * Direct address: Use "you" to address the reader directly when
       providing instructions or explanations.

    Common examples of tone

   Here are some examples of appropriate and inappropriate tone:

     * Appropriate: "To install NixOS, follow these steps carefully."
     * Inappropriate: "Installing NixOS is super easy! Here's how to do it."
     * Appropriate: "If you encounter an error, consult the troubleshooting
       section."
     * Inappropriate: "If you get an error, check the solution below!"

   Remember, the goal is to provide clear, helpful information in a
   professional manner.

Vocabulary

   Consistent use of terminology is crucial for maintaining clarity across
   the NixOS Wiki. This section outlines key terms and their preferred usage:

     * Nix: The package manager and build system at the core of NixOS.
     * NixOS: The Linux distribution built on top of the Nix package manager.
     * Nixpkgs: The collection of packages available for Nix and NixOS.
     * Derivation: A description of how to build a package in Nix.
     * Expression: A piece of Nix code that describes how to build something.
     * Channel: A versioned set of Nix expressions and binaries.
     * Flake: A newer way to package Nix code with explicit dependencies and
       outputs.
     * Attribute: A named value in a Nix expression, often used to refer to
       packages or configuration options.
     * Configuration.nix: The main configuration file for a NixOS system.

   When using these terms:

     * Be consistent in capitalization (e.g., always "NixOS", never "Nixos"
       or "NIXOS").
     * Use the full term on first mention, followed by any abbreviation in
       parentheses if it will be used later.

Linking

   Proper linking improves navigation and provides additional context for
   readers. This section covers different types of links used in the NixOS
   Wiki.

    Wikilinks

   Wikilinks are internal links to other pages within the NixOS Wiki.

     * Use double square brackets to create a wikilink:

 [[Page Name]]

     * If the link text should differ from the page name, use a pipe
       character:

 [[Page Name|displayed text]]

     * For section links, use a hash symbol. Please note: Section headings
       are sometimes changed during editing - it may be overlooked to change
       all the necessary references to them as well. Section links should
       therefore be used sparingly:

 [[Page Name#Section Name]]

    External linking

   External links point to resources outside the NixOS Wiki.

     * Use single square brackets for external links:

 [https://example.com Link text]

     * If no link text is provided, the URL itself will be displayed:

 [https://example.com]

     * For bare URLs, no brackets are needed:

 https://example.com

    Category links

   Category links help organize pages into groups.

     * Add category links at the bottom of the page:

 [[Category:Category Name]]

     * Multiple categories can be added to a single page.
     * To link to a category page without adding the current page to that
       category, use a colon before "Category":

 [[:Category:Category Name]]

Images

   Images can greatly improve the content of wiki articles. When using
   images, follow these guidelines:

     * File types: Use PNG for screenshots and diagrams, JPEG for
       photographs, and SVG for logos and icons when available.
     * Size: Keep file sizes reasonable. Aim for under 1MB for most images.
     * Alt text: Always provide descriptive alt text for accessibility.
     * Captions: Use clear, concise captions to describe the image content.
     * Alignment: Generally, align images to the right of text unless a
       different alignment better serves the content.

   To add an image:

 [[File:Example.png|thumb|right|250px|Alt text: Description of image content]]

    Image file names

   Proper image file naming helps with organization and searchability:

     * Descriptive names: Use clear, descriptive file names (e.g.,
       "nixos-installation-partitioning.png").
     * Lowercase: Use lowercase letters to avoid case-sensitivity issues.
     * Hyphens: Use hyphens (-) to separate words, not underscores or spaces.
     * Avoid special characters: Stick to alphanumeric characters and
       hyphens.
     * Version numbers: If updating an image, consider adding a version
       number (e.g., "nixos-logo-v2.svg").

   Examples of good file names:

Videos

   Videos can be a valuable addition to wiki articles, especially for
   tutorials or demonstrations. Follow these guidelines:

     * Relevance: Only include videos that directly support the article's
       content.
     * Linking: Use reputable video hosting platforms (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo)
       to link videos.
     * Permissions: Ensure you have the right to use and link the video
       content.
     * Captions: Include a descriptive caption below the video.
     * Alternative: Always provide a text-based alternative or summary of the
       video content within the article.

Lists

   Lists help organize information in a clear, readable format. The NixOS
   Wiki uses two types of lists:

  Unordered lists

   Use asterisks (*) for bullet points. Indent with additional asterisks for
   nested lists.

 * First item
 * Second item
 ** Subitem 1
 ** Subitem 2
 * Third item

  Ordered lists

   Use hash symbols (#) for numbered lists. Indent with additional hash
   symbols for nested lists.

 # First step
 # Second step
 ## Substep 1
 ## Substep 2
 # Third step

  List guidelines

     * Use sentence case for list items.
     * Be consistent with punctuation (either use periods at the end of all
       items or none).
     * Keep list items parallel in structure.
     * Avoid mixing ordered and unordered lists unless necessary for clarity.

Tables

   Tables are useful for presenting structured data. Here's how to create and
   format tables in the NixOS Wiki:

  Basic table structure

   Use the following syntax to create a basic table:

 {| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center; width: 500px;"
 |-
 ! Header 1 !! Header 2 !! Header 3
 |-
 | Row 1, Cell 1 || Row 1, Cell 2 || Row 1, Cell 3
 |-
 | Row 2, Cell 1 || Row 2, Cell 2 || Row 2, Cell 3
 |}

   Writers who use the GUI editor must then add (using the „Edit source“
   mode):

 style="text-align: center; width: 500px;"

  Table formatting

     * Use class="wikitable" for consistent styling.
     * Start each row with |-
     * Use ! for header cells and | for regular cells.
     * Align cell content using style="text-align: left/center/right;"

  Table guidelines

     * Keep tables simple and easy to read.
     * Use headers to clearly describe the content of each column.
     * Avoid excessive use of tables when prose or lists would suffice.
     * For complex tables, consider using additional CSS classes or inline
       styles for better formatting.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Translation

   Translating wiki content is crucial for making information accessible to a
   global audience. Proper translation not only conveys information
   accurately but also respects cultural nuances.

  General principles

     * Accuracy: Strive for translations that faithfully represent the
       original content without altering meaning or omitting information.
     * Clarity: Prioritize clear, understandable language over literal
       translations.
     * Consistency: Maintain consistent terminology and style across all
       translated pages.
     * Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences and adapt
       content appropriately.

  Translation process

    Preparation

     * Familiarize: Read the entire original article to understand context
       and technical terms.
     * Research: Identify established translations for NixOS-specific terms
       in your target language.
     * Tools: Machine translation is allowed for a general foundation, but it
       must be reviewed.

    Translation

     * Translate content: Begin with the main body of the article.
     * Maintain structure: Preserve the original article's structure and
       formatting.
     * Technical terms: Use glossaries for consistent translation of
       technical terms.
     * Proper nouns: Generally, do not translate names of tools, projects, or
       people.

    Review and refinement

     * Self-review: Proofread your translation for accuracy and fluency.
     * Peer review: If possible, have a native speaker review the
       translation.
     * Technical review: Ensure technical accuracy, especially for code
       snippets and commands.

  Language-specific guidelines

     * Maintain a separate page for language-specific translation guidelines.
     * Address unique challenges or conventions for each language.
     * Provide guidance on translating or adapting idiomatic expressions.

  Handling untranslatable content

     * Code snippets: Generally, do not translate code. Provide translated
       comments if necessary.
     * Commands: Keep command syntax unchanged, but translate descriptions
       and explanations.

  Metadata and navigation

     * Page titles: Use translated titles, but include the original title in
       parentheses.
     * Categories: Create and use translated category names.
     * Interlanguage links: Add appropriate interlanguage links to connect
       corresponding articles across languages.

  Quality assurance

     * Regularly review and update translations to ensure they remain
       accurate and up-to-date.
     * Encourage feedback from readers and act on suggestions for
       improvement.
     * Conduct periodic audits of translated content to maintain overall
       quality and consistency.

Templates

   Templates are pre-formatted pieces of content that can be reused across
   multiple pages. They help maintain consistency and reduce repetitive work.

  Common templates

     * Warning: A warning box used to report potential danger.
     * Note: A note box used to emphasize important information.
     * Tip: A tip box used to share helpful hints.
     * Expansion: An expansion flag used to indicate incomplete articles.

  Using templates

   To use a template, enclose its name in double curly braces:

 {{TemplateName}}

   For templates with parameters:

 {{TemplateName|parameter1=value1|parameter2=value2}}

    Template markup

   When creating new templates:

     * Use clear, descriptive names for templates.
     * Document the purpose and usage of the template on its talk page.
     * Use tags for content that should only appear on the template page
       itself.

References

   Proper referencing is crucial for maintaining the credibility and
   verifiability of wiki content. Follow these guidelines for references:

  Citation styles

     * Use inline citations with numbered references:

 This is a statement that needs a reference.<ref>Author Name, "Article Title", Publication, Date. URL</ref>

     * For multiple uses of the same reference, use named references:

 First use of the reference.<ref name="example">Author Name, "Article Title", Publication, Date. URL</ref>
 ...
 Later use of the same reference.<ref name="example" />

  General guidelines

     * Prefer primary sources and official documentation when available.
     * Avoid referencing personal blogs or unreliable sources.
     * For software-specific information, link to the official documentation
       or repository.
     * When referencing specific versions of software, include the version
       number in the citation.
