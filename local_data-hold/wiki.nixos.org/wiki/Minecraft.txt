   From NixOS Wiki

   Minecraft is a sandbox game about building, surviving, fighting, and being
   creative, developed by Mojang Studios.^[1] Minecraft currently has two
   supported variants known as:

     * Minecraft: Java Edition is only available on Windows, MacOS and Linux
       and is known for modding.
     * Minecraft: Bedrock Edition is available on Windows, Xbox One, Xbox
       Series S and X, PlayStation 4 and 5, Nintendo Switch, Android, iOS.
       Bedrock is not playable on Linux due to UWP applications not being
       supported on Linux.^[2]^[3]

Launchers

   Offical Minecraft Launcher: Website — Package/pkgs.minecraft

   Warning: 1.19 or higher is not working on NixOS, using alternative clients
   is strongly recommended.

   Prismlauncher: A free, open source launcher. Website —
   Package/pkgs.prismlauncher

   ATLauncher: A simple and easy to use Minecraft launcher which contains
   many different modpacks for you to choose from and play. Website —
   Package/pkgs.atlauncher

   Badlion Client: A closed source PvP Modpack. Website —
   Package/pkgs.badlion-client

   Lunar Client: A free Minecraft client with mods, cosmetics, and
   performance boost. Website — Package/pkgs.lunar-client

   hmcl: A Minecraft Launcher which is multi-functional, cross-platform and
   popular. Website — Package/pkgs.hmcl

Installation

   Your preferred client can be either imperatively installed by typing
   nix-env -iA nixos.<LAUNCHER> or nix profile install nixpkgs#<LAUNCHER> if
   Flakes are enabled. Preferably, install the package declaratively and
   globally by typing

 environment.systemPackages = [
   pkgs.<LAUNCHER>
 ];

   Alternatively, the package can be installed per-user with
   users.users.<USER>.packages or home-manager. For nix native, use:

 users.users.<USER>.packages = [
   pkgs.<LAUNCHER>
 ];

   For home-manager, use:

 home.packages = [
   pkgs.<LAUNCHER>
 ];

Troubleshooting

  ATlauncher can't start instance

   By default, ATlauncher installs its own Java runtime in
   **USERSDIR**/runtimes/minecraft, which gets selected in the settings' Java
   Path.

   To fix this, make sure to select the java version installed in the system
   store from the Settings > Java/Minecraft > Java Path menu and also disable
   the Use Java Provided By Minecraft? option.

   If your instance still doesn't start, check the instance settings and
   apply the same changes there.

  Prismlauncher doesn't have Java Version XX.

   The Prismlauncher package can be overridden with
   (pkgs.prismlauncher.override { jdks = [ pkgs.<JAVA_PACKAGE> ]; }). For
   example: (pkgs.prismlauncher.override { jdks = [ pkgs.temurin-bin-21
   pkgs.temurin-bin-8 pkgs.temurin-bin-17 ]; })

  Minecraft can’t start without Java Version XX.

   Different Minecraft versions need different Java versions

   Minecraft Version Minimum Compatible JRE Version 
   < 1.17            8                              
   1.17              16                             
   >= 1.18           17                             
   >= 1.20.5         21                             

  Official Minecraft Launcher fails to start the game.

   It is possible that you are attempting to start a version of Minecraft
   that is 1.19 or higher. Unfortunately, this is broken on NixOS. It is
   strongly recommended to use alternative launchers.
