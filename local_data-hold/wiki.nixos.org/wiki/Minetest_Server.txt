   Minetest is a voxel game engine than allows for many different games to be
   played.

Minetest Server Setup

   Below is a basic configuration that will setup the Minetest server and use
   port 30000.

 {
  services.minetest-server = {
    enable = true;
    port = 30000;
  };
 }

   With this setup, a user named minetest will be created, along with its
   home folder '/var/lib/minetest'. All standard Minetest configuration and
   world files are stored in /var/lib/minetest/.minetest.

   The Minetest service will be started after running nixos-rebuild. It can
   be controlled using systemctl

 systemctl start minetest-server.service
 systemctl stop minetest-server.service

   Additional options can be found in the NixOS options search
