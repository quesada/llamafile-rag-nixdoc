   From NixOS Wiki

   Many software platforms provide their own package management tools and
   maintain their own public software repositories.

   This is helpful for Nixpkgs, because it means that discrete units of code
   are already available. They're often versioned, and sometimes already have
   digests attached.

   This is a challenge for Nixpkgs, because Nix needs to adapt the
   conventions of these foreign systems to its own.

   It's preferable for a particular foreign repository to be adapted in one
   way.

   There are also general best practices we'd like to promote in the
   development of these adapters.

   Ideally, a new contributor should be able to consult the Nixpkgs manual
   regarding their language, and be able to determine precisely what they
   need to do to add their package in a consistent way.

Goals for Adapters

   Reproducibility
           This is the usual Nix requirement: a particular expression should
           produce the same output if it's re-run. At the bare minimum, two
           productions of an expression should be functionally
           indistinguishable, but this is a degraded case of operation.
