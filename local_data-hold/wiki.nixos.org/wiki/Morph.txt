   From NixOS Wiki

   Morph is a tool for managing existing NixOS hosts - basically a fancy
   wrapper around nix-build, nix copy, nix-env,
   /nix/store/.../bin/switch-to-configuration, scp and more. Morph supports
   updating multiple hosts in a row, and with support for health checks makes
   it fairly safe to do so.
