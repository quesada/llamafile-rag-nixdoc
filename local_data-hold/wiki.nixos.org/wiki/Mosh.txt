   Mosh is an alternative SSH terminal. It has support for roaming, local
   echo and uses UDP for transport. It also aims to improve responsiveness on
   intermittent, and high latency connections.

   See the mosh Package and mosh Options

Instalation

  Client

   Install the mosh package.

  Server

   Enable the programs.mosh module. You can simply add the following into
   your /etc/nixos/configuration.nix:

 # Enable mosh, the ssh alternative when client has bad connection
 # Opens UDP ports 60000 ... 61000
 programs.mosh.enable = true;

Usage

   With mosh installed on both the client and server, connect by running:

 $ mosh user@server

   Note that mosh uses SSH for authentication and initialization, so it will
   respect aliases and other options in .ssh/config. You can also specify SSH
   options using the --ssh argument. For example, to use port 1122 instead of
   22, you can either use Port 1122 in SSH config, or use mosh with the --ssh
   argument:

 $ mosh --ssh='ssh -p 1122' user@server

   More information is available at mosh.org or using man mosh

Troubleshooting

  Missing /run/user/1000

   Using a mosh session, $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR (/run/user/1000) doesn't exist and
   causes issues such as:

     * nix-shell failing with Error in tempdir() using
       /run/user/1000/nix-shell.XXXXX

   This is caused by the way mosh handles logging-in to the system, the login
   is actually handled by a short ssh session, which ends immediately.
   logind, as it is used, closes the user's session and cleans up behind,
   since there is no lingering configured by default.

   To enable lingering use:

 $ loginctl enable-linger $USER

   Then reconnect with mosh. Note that lingering is enabled by default in
   NixOS >= 16.09.

   As a workaround, it is also possible to set an alias in the user's shell
   on the server wrapping mosh-server to keep the session around. ^[1]

 alias mosh-server = "systemd-run --user --scope mosh-server"

   See also https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/3702#issue-40762878

  The locale requested by LANG=*** isn't available here.

   This error occurs when trying to connect to a linux server (non-NixOS
   distribution) on which mosh-server has been installed via nix. The easy
   solution is to set LOCALE_ARCHIVE to your OS locale-archive in your
   .profile or .zshenv:

 export LOCALE_ARCHIVE=/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive
