About

   mtr is a network diagnostic tool that combines ping and traceroute into
   one program. Nixpkgs contains two flavors of it: the standalone
   application and a prometheus-ready exporter:

 {
   programs.mtr.enable = true;
   services.mtr-exporter.enable = true;
 }

Issues

  mtr needs to be called with sudo

   To avoid the need to escalate privileges when calling mtr create a setcap
   wrapper by setting

 programs.mtr.enable = true;
