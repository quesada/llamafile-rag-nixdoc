   Multipath TCP is a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) extension to be
   able to use multiple paths for a single TCP connection
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mptcp/). Applications can aggregate the
   troughput of a cellular and wifi link for instance.

   It is backwards compatible with TCP: you don't need to modify applications
   but just to enable an MPTCP-aware linux kernel. 2 such kernels exist: -
   the historical out-of-tree featureful implementation developed at
   multipath-tcp.org/

  boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackages_mptcp;

   - use the upstream implementation (still being worked on) available
   starting from linux 5.6

  boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackagesFor ( pkgs.linux_5_6.override {
    structuredExtraConfig = with lib.kernel; {
      MPTCP     =yes;
      MPTCP_IPV6=yes;
    };
  });
