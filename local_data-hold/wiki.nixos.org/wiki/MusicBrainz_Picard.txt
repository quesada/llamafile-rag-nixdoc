Troubleshooting

  Cannot scan songs to get AcoustOD fingerprints

   Error messages like this one will show in the console when scanning songs:

 E: 00:00:00 Fingerprint calculator failed error = No such file or directory (0)

   MusicBrainz Picard has an optional dependency on chromaprint. Installing
   it (nix-env -iA nixos.chromaprint or through configuration.nix) will allow
   AcoustID fingerprinting to work.
