   From NixOS Wiki

   MySQL and MariaDB are installed via the same services.mysql configuration.

     * MySQL is a widely used open source relational database management
       system (RDBMS) that offers various features, tools, and services for
       data warehousing, analytics, machine learning, and more.
     * MariaDB is a popular and stable fork of MySQL that is compatible with
       MySQL and has additional enhancements and features.

                                  Setup MySQL

   Setup and enable Mysql database daemon (in this example: latest stable
   version in nixpkgs)

 services.mysql = {
   enable = true;
   package = pkgs.mysql;
 };

                                 Setup MariaDB

   Setup and enable MariaDB database daemon (in this example: version 11.0)

 services.mysql = {
   enable = true;
   package = pkgs.mariadb_110;
 };

                                  Maintenance

Upgrade

   NixOS will not run mysql_upgrade automatically for you after upgrading to
   a new major version, because it is a "dangerous" operation (can lead to
   data corruption) and users are strongly advised (by MariaDB upstream) to
   backup their database before running mysql_upgrade.

 mysqldump -u root -p --all-databases > alldb.sql

   After backup is completed, you can proceed with the upgrade process

 mysql_upgrade
