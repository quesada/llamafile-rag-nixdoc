   From NixOS Wiki

     NNCP (Node to Node copy) is a collection of utilities simplifying secure
     store-and-forward files, mail and command exchanging.

     These utilities are intended to help build up small size (dozens of
     nodes) ad-hoc friend-to-friend (F2F) statically routed darknet
     delay-tolerant networks for fire-and-forget secure reliable files, file
     requests, Internet mail and commands transmission. All packets are
     integrity checked, end-to-end encrypted, explicitly authenticated by
     known participants public keys. Onion encryption is applied to relayed
     packets. Each node acts both as a client and server, can use push and
     poll behaviour model. Also there is multicasting areas support.

     Out-of-box offline sneakernet/floppynet, dead drops, sequential and
     append-only CD-ROM/tape storages, air-gapped computers support. But
     online TCP daemon with full-duplex resumable data transmission exists.

Configuration

   NNCP can be installed and configured manually or via NixOS configuration.

   In any case the first step is to generate a configuration file.

 $ nncp-cfgnew -nocomments > /etc/secrets/nncp.hjson

   This file generated file be stripped down to include only the self and
   neigh sections:

 {
   self: {
     # DO NOT show anyone your private keys!!!
     id: HFTEI…SITTA
     exchpub: RG2SF…7JEYA
     exchprv: 4YAON…LWCMA
     signpub: ASKTA…EFVSQ
     signprv: Z6Q4R…SC2ZI
     noiseprv: ACJVW…7G7NA
     noisepub: J2W5C…SZM6Q
   }
   neigh: {
     self: {
       id: HFTEI…SITTA
       exchpub: RG2SF…7JEYA
       signpub: ASKTA…EFVSQ
       noisepub: J2W5C…SZM6Q
     }
   }
 }

   The location of this file should be defined in your NixOS configuration at
   programs.nncp.secrets:

 {
   programs.nncp = {
     enable = true;
     secrets = [ "/etc/secrets/nncp.hjson" ];
   };
 }

   In this example the secret keys are stored outside the Nix store an we
   will add public keys for neighboring nodes in the NixOS configuration.

 {
   programs.nncp = {
     enable = true;
     secrets = [ "/etc/secrets/nncp.hjson" ];
     neigh = {
       alice = {
         # information that Alice has given us about her "self".
         id = "D6BOO…YTYWQ";
         exchpub = "V4WJ6…4VA3Q";
         signpub = "NZLTN…HCGOA";
         noisepub = "UNL2J…7FRDA";
         # We can connect directly to Alice over network.
         addr = {
           lan = "[fe80::1234%igb0]:5400";
           internet = "alice.com:3389";
           proxied = "|ssh remote.host nncp-daemon -ucspi";
         };
       };
       bob = {
         # information that Bob has given us about his "self".
         id = "3I3HC…F4P4Q";
         exchpub = "7VJN7…BWUTQ";
         signpub = "E6XSC…5VYRA";
         noisepub = "TAKXG…Z6MZQ";
         # We cannoct connect to Bob but be can relay packets to him thru Alice.
         via = [ "alice" ];
       };
     };
   };
 }

Callers and Daemons

   Automatically starting the nncp-caller and nncp-daemon programs is not yet
   available from a NixOS module.

Remote command execution

  Store path importing

   NNCP config:

 {
   programs.nncp.settings.neigh.${NODE}.exec.nix-store-import = "nix-store --import";
 }

   Export command:

 $ nix-store --export ./result | nncp-exec "$NODE" nix-store-import
