   From NixOS Wiki

   New Technology File System (NTFS) is a proprietary journaling file system
   developed by Microsoft. It is still in use by modern Windows system,
   although NTFS didnt evolve since the release of version 3.1 in 2001.

Enable NTFS support at boot

 boot.supportedFilesystems = [ "ntfs" ];

   NixOS uses NTFS-3G for NTFS support.

  Enable write mode

   fileSystems."/path/to/mount/to" =
     { device = "/path/to/the/device";
       fsType = "ntfs-3g";
       options = [ "rw" "uid=theUidOfYourUser"];
     };

Mount NTFS filesystem

 # mount /dev/sdeX /mnt -t ntfs3

Mount NTFS filesystem on boot

    1. Add NTFS support to /etc/nixos/configuration.nix (see #Enable NTFS
       support at boot above)
    2. Run the following commands

 # Apply new config on next boot
 sudo nixos-rebuild boot
 # Reboot your system
 reboot

 # Mount the hard drive. Replace X & /mnt/folder as needed
 mount /dev/sdX /mnt/folder -t ntfs3

 # Generate /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix
 nixos-generate-config

    3. Edit /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix

   # /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix

   # Your /dev/disk/by/uuid/... and /mnt/folder will have different names!
   fileSystems."/mnt/folder" =
       { device = "/dev/disk/by-uuid/7997ef90-6333-4c60-b137-d5cf2423e91b";
 -       fsType = "ntfs3";
 +       fsType = "ntfs-3g";
 +       options = [ "rw" "uid=UID"];
       };

       Note: you can quickly find your UID by running echo $UID
    4. Run nixos-rebuild switch
    5. Done!

Troubleshooting

  Read-only file system

   This is most likely caused by Windows not marking the disk as "clean" and
   unmounted.

   To verify:

 journalctl -b0 | grep -i "The disk contains an unclean file system"

   It should return a similar message to what follows:

 The disk contains an unclean file system (0,0). Metadata
 kept in Windows cache, refused to mount. Falling back to
 read-only mount because the NTFS partition is in an unsafe
 state. Please resume and shutdown Windows fully (no
 hibernation or fast restarting.)

   If you have shutdown Windows fully, and not used hibernation, it may be
   caused by the fast startup or fast boot feature of Windows. It has been
   reported that major Windows updates may reset this setting to on.

   This TechNet entry explains how to disable fast startup. Additionally,
   this blog post on howtogeek.com explains how the fast startup mode works,
   and how to disable it.
