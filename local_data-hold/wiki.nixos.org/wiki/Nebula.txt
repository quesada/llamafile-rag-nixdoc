   From NixOS Wiki

   Nebula is a meshing overlay network made as an open-source program by
   Slack. You can seamlessly mesh hundreds, thousands, or more machines
   across the globe, using minimal changes to your process.

   Nebula runs by assigning a number of nodes the role of "lighthouse". These
   nodes should be assigned a public global IP address - any kind of NAT or
   port forwarding is likely to render your lighthouses useless. A minimal
   $5/mo cloud machine is good enough to run as a lighthouse node, and
   luckily no traffic passes through those nodes; they only broker the
   peer-to-peer connections of the other nodes in your mesh.

Lighthouse Node

   In Nebula, a "lighthouse" is a signaling node accessible through a public
   IP address, using UDP port 4242.

   Because you're likely using a cloud server option for your lighthouse,
   there is a chance you'll be unable to use NixOS on that node. Double check
   the NixOS friendly hosters article your options for running NixOS in the
   cloud], or choose a secondary distribution and look for the nebula
   package, and go through the Quick Start guide.

   A simple configuration may look like:

   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ nebula ];
   services.nebula.networks.mesh = {
     enable = false;
     isLighthouse = true;
     cert = "/etc/nebulanode.crt";
     key = "/etc/nebula/node.key";
     ca = "/etc/nebula/ca.crt";
   };

   Here is a quick process for making a certificate authority (ca) and a
   certificate for a lighthouse node, called "beacon".

 > mkdir ~/mesh && cd ~/mesh
 > nebula-cert ca -name mesh
 > nebula-cert sign -ca-crt ./ca.crt -ca-key ./ca.key -name beacon -ip 10.0.0.1
 > ls
 ca.crt  ca.key  node.crt  node.key

   Of these four files produced, you should do as much as you can to keep
   ca.key secure.
