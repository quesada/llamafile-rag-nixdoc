   From NixOS Wiki

   A virtual machine can be created , it will use your
   /etc/nixos/configuration.nix to make a 'clone' of your system. Useful for
   testing new configurations.

   nixos-rebuild build-vm

   nixos-rebuild build-vm -I nixos-config=./configuration.nix -I
   nix_path='<nixpkgs/nixos>' --max-jobs 4 --show-trace # e.g. to specify the
   environment variables / cores used

   You can also use build-vm-with-bootloader. From the man page: this boots
   using the regular boot loader of your configuration rather than booting
   directly into the kernel and initial ramdisk of the system.

   You will not be able to login to this virtual machine, as the passwords
   are not carried over to the virtual machine you build.

   You should have user nixosvmtest (isSystemUser or isNormalUser)

 users.users.nixosvmtest.isSystemUser = true ;
 users.users.nixosvmtest.initialPassword = "test";

   If you have a user called nixosvmtest for example, you can add

 users.users.nixosvmtest.group = "nixosvmtest";
 users.groups.nixosvmtest = {};

   to your /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

   you should now be able to login and test your system with this user and
   password.

   https://discourse.nixos.org/t/default-login-and-password-for-nixos/4683/2

   By default, the virtual machine is configured to have 1 CPU and 1024MiB
   memory. It may be too small for testing with desktop environment enabled
   inside. You can set options virtualisation.vmVariant.virtualisation.cores
   and virtualisation.vmVariant.virtualisation.memorySize to enlarge the CPU
   cores and memory size for the virtual machine.

 {
 virtualisation.vmVariant = {
   # following configuration is added only when building VM with build-vm
   virtualisation = {
     memorySize =  2048; # Use 2048MiB memory.
     cores = 3;        
   };
 }

   Use virtualisation.vmVariantWithBootLoader option if you used
   `build-vm-with-bootloader` earlier.

Troubleshooting

  Still can't login after updating configuration

   When running a virtual machine a file called $hostname.qcow2 is created in
   your current working directory. After changing your
   /etc/nixos/configuration.nix delete this file, rebuild and then start the
   new virtual machine. Now you should be able to login.

Alternatives

  Bootable ISO

   Build it as a bootable ISO image:

  VM

 {
 ...
   imports = [
     <nixos/nixos/modules/virtualisation/virtualbox-image.nix> ]
 ...

   nix build -f '<nixpkgs/nixos>' -I nixos-config=./configuration.nix
   config.system.build.virtualBoxOVA Source
