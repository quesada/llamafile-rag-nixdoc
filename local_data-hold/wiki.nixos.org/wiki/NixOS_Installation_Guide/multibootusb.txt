   When using multibootusb to create a boot stick, which can boot multiple
   ISOs and then booting the NixOS ISO from it, there is a problem with
   mounting the ISO in the first stage.

   It says something like

 An error occurred in stage 1 of the boot process, which must
 mount the root filesystem on '/mnt-root' and start the stage 2.
 Press one of the following keys:
   i) to launch an interactive shell
   f) to start an interactive shell having pid 1
      (needed if you want to start stage 2's init manually)
   r) to reboot immediately
   *) to ignore the error and continue

   Then press i to launch a shell. In the shell execute

 # fdisk -l #To find the block device for your multiboot partition on the usb stick.
 # mkdir /mnt
 # mount /dev/sdXY /mnt #Use the multiboot partition's block device
 # mount -o loop -t iso9660 /mnt/multiboot/nixos-<version>-linux/nixos-<version>-linux.iso /mnt-root/iso/
 # exit

   Now the boot process should continue as usual.
