   @dezgeg's porting efforts to ARMv7 works on the TinkerBoard, with some
   modification for u-boot and DTB paths. Support for this board is a work in
   progress. Please contact me (@tomberek) for
   comments/thoughts/feedback/etc.

Board-specific installation notes

   First follow the generic installation steps to get the installer image on
   an SD card.

   The Tinker Board seems to look for U-Boot at a specific offset rather than
   in a file. So copy the initial 4MB from the TinkerOS image and then copy
   it to the NixOS image while skipping the MBR/partition table in the first
   512 bytes. It turns out the bootstrap section of the MBR is also needed,
   so copy that as well.

   These commands may use either the /dev/sdX or the file images and later
   copied to SD cards - this was discovered iteratively, thus was performed
   on the sd cards directly. Use with caution. (Assumes /dev/sdc is TinkerOS
   and /dev/sdb is NixOS images or devices respectively).

 dd if=/dev/sdc of=tinker_sector bs=512k count=8 status=progress # grab tinker initial sectors
 dd if=tinker_sector of=/dev/sdb bs=512 skip=1 seek=1 count=8191 # copy the img and env blobs
 dd of=/dev/sdb if=tinker_sector bs=428 count=1 # bootstrap code from begining of MBR

   It turns out that getting into U-Boot using the TinkerOS image, halting
   the boot process, replacing SD cards with the NixOS image fails, but the
   error message suggests the extlinux merely has a different name for the
   DTB than NixOS has packaged. Simply copy from the nixos dtb file
   `/boot/nixos/<hash>-dtbs/rk3288-tinker.dtb` to
   `rockchip-tinker_rk3288.dtb`.

   Then, install using the installation and configuration steps.

Serial console

   Your configuration.nix will need to modify the default boot.kernelParams
   configuration to use the serial console.

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 boot.kernelParams = [
     "console=ttymxc0,115200n8" # HDMI?
     "console=tty0"             # Primary Console?
     "console=ttyS1,115200n8"   # Serial port?
     "console=ttyS2,115200n8"   # Serial port pins 8+10
  ];

TODO

     * Build U-boot from upstream
     * upload images/blobs
     * host binary cache
