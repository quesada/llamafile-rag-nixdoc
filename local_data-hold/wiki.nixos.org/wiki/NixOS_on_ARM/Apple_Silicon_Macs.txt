   Apple Silicon Macs are supported in large part by the efforts of the Asahi
   Linux project. All M1 Macs and most M2 Macs are supported currently, with
   M3 Mac support in progress.

Status

   NixOS should be at least as well supported as the official Asahi Linux
   distribution. Enough hardware works currently for a pleasant desktop and
   laptop Linux experience, including booting off the internal NVMe drive.

Board Specific Installation Notes

   Apple's boot and security architecture is complex, but abstracting all
   that away into a standard UEFI environment is handled by the Asahi Linux
   installer and project. Those who want to learn more may want to read
   Introduction to Apple Silicon.

   Currently, not enough hardware support is upstream for the official NixOS
   installer to work properly on Apple Silicon Macs. A comprehensive guide to
   using the Asahi Linux installer to install NixOS with a customized NixOS
   ISO is available.
