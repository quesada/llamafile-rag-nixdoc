Building U-Boot

 $ git clone git://git.denx.de/u-boot.git
 $ cd u-boot
 $ nix-shell -p ubootTools gcc-arm-embedded dtc flex bison swig 'python311.withPackages(ps: with ps; [ setuptools ])' openssl libuuid gnutls
 $ make -j4 ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi- Bananapi_defconfig
 $ make -j4 ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi-

Board-specific installation notes

   First follow the generic installation steps to get the installer image.

   U-Boot needs to be copied to specific sectors on the microSD card with dd:

 sudo dd if=u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/dev/sdX bs=1024 seek=8

   Then, install using the installation and configuration steps.

SATA Port multiplier (PMP)

   It used to be necessary to make some changes to the kernel source and
   recompile, but on recent linux versions (including the one shipped with
   the NixOS arm image) this is no longer necessary. Instead, all that is
   required is merely to set

 boot.kernelParams = ["ahci_sunxi.enable_pmp=1"]

   in configuration.nix. Note that this will prevent the use of a hard drive
   connected to the SATA port directly without a port multiplier in between.

   See here for more details.
