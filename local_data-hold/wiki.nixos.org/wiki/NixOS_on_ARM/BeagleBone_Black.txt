   @dezgeg's porting efforts to ARMv7 should work.

Board-specific installation notes

   First follow the generic installation steps to get the installer image.

   U-Boot and its SPL (called the MLO) need to be copied to specific sectors
   on the microSD card with dd. Download U-Boot & MLO for the board
   (uboot-am335x_boneblack_defconfig-2017.03_u-boot.img,
   uboot-am335x_boneblack_defconfig-2017.03_MLO), and copy them to the
   correct location with (again, replace /dev/sdX with the correct path to
   the SD card device):

 sudo dd if=uboot-am335x_boneblack_defconfig-2017.03_MLO        of=/dev/sdX count=1 seek=1 bs=128k
 sudo dd if=uboot-am335x_boneblack_defconfig-2017.03_u-boot.img of=/dev/sdX count=2 seek=1 bs=384k

   In case there is a valid boot loader on the eMMC of the board and the
   NixOS U-Boot isn't getting launched, try holding the button labeled 'S2'
   when resetting the board. Also the boot ROM might have a size limitation
   on the microSD cards used for booting; the author wasn't able to get a 64
   GB SDXC card working but a 8 GB SDHC card worked.

   Then, install using the installation and configuration steps.

Serial console

     This article or section needs expansion.                                 
     Reason: The exact console parameter is needed. (Discuss in Talk:NixOS on 
     ARM/BeagleBone Black#)                                                   
     Please consult the pedia article metapage for guidelines on              
     contributing.                                                            

Notes about the boot process

   Only serial console (via the 6-pin FTDI pin header) is supported.
