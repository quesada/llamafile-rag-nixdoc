   Firefly AIO-3399C
   A Firefly AIO-3399C attached to LVDS
   Manufacturer Firefly                                              
   Architecture AArch64                                              
   Bootloader   u-boot with ARM trusted boot and Rockchip Miniloader 
   Boot order   official: eMMC                                       
   Maintainer   makefu                                               

Status

   The board boots NixOS from eMMC with the downstream u-boot and Rockchip
   trusted boot blob. Also flashing Rockchip tertiary bootloader
   (**idbloader**).

   Additionally image provided by firefly on the chinese download page, click
   on Ubuntu (GPT). The image has also been uploaded to archive.org.

   The official documentation, which is a pretty good state, can be found at
   the wiki of firefly.

Serial console

   On the board there are 3 pins which have a 2.54mm pitch, this is the debug
   console with the text DEBUG on it. Starting from the middle to the side of
   the board:

     * GND (Black Wire)
     * RX (White Wire)
     * TX (Green Wire)
     * VCC, only the silver trace point and not a pin

   Baud rate is 1500000 Connect to it via:

 nix-shell -p picocom --run "picocom -b 1500000 /dev/ttyUSB0"

   When you build your own image, you need the following extra kernel
   command-line parameters to get serial output:

 {
   boot.kernelParams = lib.mkForce ["console=ttyS2,1500000n8" "earlycon=uart8250,mmio32,0xff1a0000" "earlyprintk"];
 }

   Make sure you disable other consoles (tty0) as they seem to interfere with
   the output.

Board-specific installation notes

  Installation onto eMMC

   Note: it may be necessary to first flash the ubuntu gpt image before
   overriding the partitions with NixOS, use upgrade_tool UF
   ./AIO-3399C-UBUNTU16.04-LVDS-GPT.img

    boot parts

   For booting the Image you will need the following parts:

    1. idbloader (rockchip proprietary)
    2. u-boot customized by firefly
    3. ARM Trusted image customized for working with uboot

   The whole setup can be built by hand with the following scripts originally
   from user samueldr.

 git clone https://github.com/makefu/ROC-RK3399-PC-overlay.git builder && cd builder
 nix-build -A pkgsCross.aarch64-multiplatform.AIO-3399C.firmware
 ls result/
 cp result/{idbloader.img,uboot.img,trust.img} .

    boot and rootfs

   The latest linux kernel (4.19 and up) is working with this board. Instead
   of building the image yourself you can fetch the latest sd-image from
   hydra and dd the created images onto the separate partitions. You can find
   all the successful builds in hydra @
   nixos:release-18.09-aarch64:nixos.sd_image.aarch64-linux

 # get the latest link directly from hydra
 wget https://hydra.nixos.org/build/89033499/download/1/nixos-sd-image-18.09.2227.ea0820818a7-aarch64-linux.img -O sd.img
 udisksctl loop-setup -f sd.img -r
 dd if=/dev/loop0p1 boot.img
 dd if=/dev/loop0p2 root.img

    Bringing the device into Rockchip loader mode

   The board can easily be flashed by booting the device into the Rockchip
   loader mode. The device exposes the emmc with the rockusb protocol to a
   connected host pc.

   To bring the device in the loader mode:

    1. Disconnect from power
    2. Connect USB-C from the board to your computer
    3. Hold 'Recovery' button pressed
    4. Connect power, wait for 2 (or more) seconds
    5. Short press the 'reset' button and release the 'Recovery' button
       afterwards

    flashing all boot parts

 # You should have the following files available:
 $ ls *.img
 boot.img root.img trust.img uboot.img idbloader.img

 # enter loader or maskrom mode
 nix-build -A AIO-3399C.upgrade_tool
 # optional: re-flash the rockchip loader, haven't tested
 # result/bin/upgrade_tool UL idbloader.img
 result/bin/upgrade_tool di -u uboot.img -t trust.img -boot ./boot.img -rootfs root.img
 result/bin/upgrade_tool rd # reset

   Now cross fingers, the system should boot into NixOS now, the getty BAUD
   rate will change to 115200.

Compatibility notes

   See the Rockchip compatibility matrix. Uboot requires the Rockchip
   Miniloader and an arm trusted boot image.

  Downstream kernel

   The downstream kernel sources can be found on github at [1]. The stable
   kernel branch they are maintaining is 4.4, however mainline 4.19 is
   already work according to the Rockchip compatibility matrix.

  u-boot

   Firefly maintains an own u-boot fork at [2].

  Firefly upgrade_tool

   Firefly provides an upgrade_tool which is a modified rock-chip upgrade
   tool. Using the upstream tool however may result in weird errors like
   being unable to flash the image or being unable to erase the flash. To be
   sure use the archive.org mirror.

   However, because the software is essentially a blob, you will need to
   either patchelf the thing or use steam-run:

 nix-shell -p steam-run --run "steam-run ./upgrade_tool"

   I tried flashing with the open-source rkflashtool (in the same repo as the
   u-boot stuff), however i was unable to actually connect to the device
   neither in "loader" nor in "maskrom" mode. I resorted to using the closed
   source blob upgrade_tool which works directly.

  Rockchip MaskROM Mode

   Maskrom mode is a way to get extended privileges when flashing but you
   need to shorten two trace points on the board. Follow the official
   documentation. However the loader mode should be enough for most things.
