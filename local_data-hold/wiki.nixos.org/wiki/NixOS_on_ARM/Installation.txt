    This article or section is out of date.                                   
    Reason: This page needs a cleanup; it was migrated from an organically    
    evolving article from about three wikis ago. The information may still be 
    accurate though. (Discuss in Talk:NixOS on ARM/Installation)              
    Once the page has been updated this notice can be removed.                

Installation

  Getting the installer

    UEFI iso

   Note: On Raspberry Pi devices, the NixOS ISO are not compatible due to
   hardware limitations rather than issues with the NixOS installer itself.
   As a result, it is recommended to use the SD card images files (.img)
   instead for a successful installation experience.

   Continue to the UEFI page.

    SD card images (SBCs and similar platforms)

   For AArch64 it is possible to download images from Hydra.

     * 24.05
     * unstable (LTS kernel)
     * unstable (Latest kernel)

   On the page click on the latest successful build to get a download link
   under build products.

  Installation steps

   The .img files can be directly written to a microSD/SD card (minimal
   recommended size: 4 GB) using dd, once uncompressed from the ZSTD
   container. The SD card needs to be unmounted first.

   Once the NixOS image file is downloaded, run the following command to
   install the image onto the SD Card, replace /dev/mmcblk0 with the path to
   the SD card (use dmesg to find it out) and image.img with the path to the
   image.

   sudo dd if=image.img of=/dev/mmcblk0

   This should be enough to get you started, you may now boot your device for
   the first time.

   The base images are configured to boot up with a serial TTY ( RX/TX UART )
   @ 115200 Baud. That way you not necessarily have to have a HDMI Display
   and keyboard.

   Note: If the image has the extension .zst, it will need to be decompressed
   before writing to installation device. Use

   nix-shell -p zstd --run "zstdcat image.img.zst | dd of=/dev/mmcblk0
   status=progress"

   to decompress the image on-the-fly.

   Note: For some platforms, manually editing and adding kernel command-line
   arguments to /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf may be needed for serial to
   work, and is "as" supported as would be editing the command-line manually
   during boot.
