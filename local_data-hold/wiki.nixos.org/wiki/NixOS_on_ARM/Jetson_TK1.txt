Status

     This article or section is out of date.                                  
     Reason: Section refers to old user-provided images. Should be reviewed   
     with cross-compilation, or native compilation through userspace          
     emulation. (Discuss in Talk:NixOS on ARM/Jetson TK1)                     
     Once the page has been updated this notice can be removed.               

   @dezgeg's porting efforts to ARMv7 should work.

Board-specific installation notes

   The proprietary NVIDIA bootloader can only boot NVIDIA's L4T kernel, so it
   needs to be replaced by flashing U-Boot on the board's eMMC via the
   recovery USB port. The easiest way to do that is to use
   tegra-uboot-flasher-scripts, though unfortunately that's currently not
   packaged in NixOS. Once U-Boot is flashed, the ARMv7 image will boot
   out-of-the-box.

   To get the ARMv7 image, follow the generic installation steps.

   Finally, install using the installation and configuration steps.

Serial console

     This article or section needs expansion.                                 
     Reason: The exact console parameter is needed. (Discuss in Talk:NixOS on 
     ARM/Jetson TK1#)                                                         
     Please consult the pedia article metapage for guidelines on              
     contributing.                                                            

Notes about the boot process

   Only serial console (via the DB-9 connector) is supported.
