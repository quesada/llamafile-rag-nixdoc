   From NixOS Wiki
   ← Back to NixOS on ARM

   We now have https://github.com/novena-next/nixos-novena repository that
   can be used to build Novena specific kernel and few other tools like
   novena-eeprom and novena-usb-hub.

   Also check out https://github.com/novena-next/docs for general purpose
   documentation. This guide might move there at some point.

  Using generic image

   NixOS on ARM

   use generic armv7l image (sd-image-armv7l-linux.img)

  U-boot

   Build u-boot according to

   NixOS_on_ARM#Building_u-boot_from_your_NixOS_PC

 make novena_defconfig

 dd if=SPL of=/dev/sdc seek=1 bs=1k

   Store u-boot.bin on /boot (mounted sd-image).

   Proceed with standard installation steps and
   NixOS_on_ARM#Building_U-Boot_from_your_NixOS_PC

   You can use your own layout when installing on the hard drive (SD-card is
   still needed to boot from SATA), extlinux insted of grub is important.

  Configuring SATA boot

   To enable booting from SATA by default enable sataroot feature with
   novena-eeprom and then break to u-boot shell and run following commands to
   set different boot order:

   TODO: disk ID

 printenv
 setenv boot_targets sata0
 saveenv
 reset
