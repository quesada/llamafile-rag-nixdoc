   AML-S905X-CC-V2
   Manufacturer Libre Computer 
   Architecture AArch64        
   Bootloader   U-Boot or UEFI 
   Maintainer   Programmerino  

Status

   The only tested installation method is using NixOS_on_ARM/UEFI, although
   limited testing with the generic SD image also showed promise

Board-specific installation notes

   Follow the generic UEFI installation steps, and make sure to use an image
   which has at least kernel 6.2 to avoid networking issues. These images are
   recommended.

   The biggest hurdle is making sure you have the latest bootloader
   installed. The easiest approach is to use the official flashing tool on a
   microSD card (or potentially directly onto the SPI flash if you already
   have an OS booted), and then write the NixOS ISO to a USB drive. Although
   this isn't documented, it appears that the physical boot switch chooses
   whether to choose the bootloader from the flash memory or the microSD
   card. If you just flashed the new bootloader to a microSD card, make sure
   it is set in the position closest to the I/O (ethernet, USB ports, etc.),
   otherwise, set it to the opposite direction.

Configuration

  Use latest kernel

   As of writing, the stable LTS kernel is not 6.2+ and thus the default
   configuration.nix will cause networking issues. To avoid this, make the
   change below:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 {
   boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackages_latest;
 }

Troubleshooting

  Selecting any boot option resets the board

   You probably are not using the latest platform firmware, or the physical
   boot switch is not set correctly (and that is causing you to boot from the
   factory bootloader). See the instructions above.

  Squashfs errors

   Use the copytoram boot option
