   The NanoPC-T4 is a single board computer built around the Rockchip RK3399
   SoC.

Status

   The board boots NixOS from eMMC and will also load NixOS via its
   integrated microSD reader.

   The official documentation, which is comprehensive, can be found on the
   FriendlyElec wiki.

   U-Boot for this board is not entirely open, incorporating a binary blob
   for the tertiary program loader (TPL). Compilation instructions are
   featured in section 15.7 of the FriendlyElec wiki, and a build target is
   also provided in upstream u-boot (nanopc-t4-rk3399_defconfig).

   Pre-built u-boot images are available here.

Board Specific Installation Notes

  Installation onto eMMC

   These instructions assume that you have booted the NanoPC-T4 via an OS
   loaded via its microSD card. A recent Armbian boot image should flash and
   boot cleanly (follow their docs).

   The NanoPC-T4 reserves space for u-boot at the beginning of its eMMC
   and/or microSD. As a result, successful image installation relies upon a
   custom partitioning scheme.

 # dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mmcblk2 bs=1M count=32

 # fdisk /dev/mmcblk2
 Command (m for help): g
 Created a new GPT disklabel (GUID: 2E750097-829F-614C-AD9E-271DA3413E3E).
 Command (m for help): n
 Partition number (1-128, default 1):
 First sector (2048-30535646, default 2048): 32768
 Last sector, +/-sectors or +/-size{K,M,G,T,P} (32768-30535646, default 30535646):
 Created a new partition 1 of type 'Linux filesystem' and of size 14.6 GiB.
 Command (m for help): w

 # Make the filesystem
 # mkfs.ext4 /dev/mmcblk2p1
 # set the disk label (crucially important)
 # tune2fs -L NIXOS_SD /dev/mmcblk2p1

   After partitioning, you can write the u-boot images as follows.

 # dd if=idbloader.bin of=/dev/mmcblk2 seek=64 conv=notrunc
 # dd if=uboot.img of=/dev/mmcblk2 seek=16384 conv=notrunc
 # dd if=trust.bin of=/dev/mmcblk2 seek=24576 conv=notrunc

    Boot and RootFS

   The latest linux kernel is working with this board. Instead of building
   the image yourself you can fetch the latest sd-image from hydra and dd the
   created images onto the separate partitions. You can find recent
   successful builds here.

 # get the latest link directly from hydra
 # wget https://hydra.nixos.org/build/135139819/download/1/nixos-sd-image-20.09.2623.97a13fb97fc-aarch64-linux.img.zst -O sd.img.zst
 # unzstd sd.img.zst
 # udisksctl loop-setup -f sd.img -r

 # copy the root filesystem to the partition you created earlier
 # mkdir eemc imgroot
 # mount /dev/mmcblk2p1 eemc
 # mount /dev/loop0p2 imgroot
 # cd imgroot
 # tar cf - . | (cd ../eemc && tar xvf -)
 # sync
 # cd .. && umount eemc imgroot

   After writing the filesystem, shutdown the system completely (power off
   state), remove the SD card, power it back up, and if everything went well,
   it should boot into Nix via eMMC.

    Bypassing eMMC to boot SD

   From a fully powered off state, hold the Boot button and then long-press
   the power button to power up the board. Continue holding the Boot button
   for ~5 seconds, and the board will be forced to enter the MASKROM mode
   which bypasses the eMMC MBR.

    UART

   The base images are configured to boot up with a serial TTY ( RX/TX UART )
   @ 115200 Baud. I had to replace console=ttyS0,115200n8 with
   console=ttyS2,115200n8 in /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf to make the serial
   console work.

   Note: the NanoPC-T4 UART defaults to the Debug UART Pin Spec which is
   adjacent to the USB-C port and is not part of the 40 Pin GPIO Pin Spec
   (see the aforementioned wiki).

  Networking

   The NanoPC-T4 integrated wifi does not work out of the box. Getting it to
   work requires the following steps:

 # mkdir -p /lib/firmware/brcm
 # cp brcmfmac4356-sdio.txt /lib/firmware/brcm/
 # rmmod brcmfmac
 # modprobe brcmfmac
 # wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c <(wpa_passphrase $YOUR_SSID $YOUR_PASSWORD)

   You can get a copy of brcmfmac4356-sdio.txt here.

  Bluetooth Messages During Install

   Depending on your hardware, the default boot image can be extremely noisy
   regarding messages related to bluetooth. If you would like to turn these
   off (temporarily), you can do the following.

 # echo "install bluetooth /bin/false" > /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
 # reboot
