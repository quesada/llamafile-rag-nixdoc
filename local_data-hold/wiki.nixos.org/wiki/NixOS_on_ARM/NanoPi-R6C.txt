Hardware

   NanoPi-R6C and R6S are single board computers built around the Rockchip
   RK3588S SoC.

     * CPU: ARM Cortex-A76 and Cortex-A55
     * GPU: Mali-G610 MP4
     * RAM: 4GB/8GB LPDDR4X at 2133MHz
     * MMC: None or 32GB eMMC
     * NET: Native Gigabit Ethernet, PCIe 2.5G Ethernet
     * USB: 1x USB 3.0 Type-A, 1x USB 2.0 Type-A
     * PCIe: 1x M.2 Key M connector with PCIe 2.1 x1

Status

   The board boots systems like Armbian from USB pendrive or microSD reader
   out of the box. But stock NixOS arch64 images do not boot correctly due to
   lack of correct DTS file called rockchip-nanopi6.dtb. You can see details
   of research into the boot process here.

   The official documentation, which is comprehensive, can be found on the
   FriendlyElec wiki.

   U-Boot for this board can be compiled from source, and an example of how
   that can be done with Nix is here. But the best way to manage booting on
   this device is using the EDK2 UEFI firmware which supports booting from
   all available storage options, including NVMe, and works well both with
   standard NixOS ISO images as well as Armbian ones.

Board Specific Installation Notes

  UEFI Firmware

   Boot into a working Linux system, like Armbian using USB pendrive or SD
   Card, then simply write the UEFI image to the eMMC:

 wget https://github.com/edk2-porting/edk2-rk3588/releases/download/v0.9.1/nanopi-r6c_UEFI_Release_v0.9.1.img
 sudo dd if=nanopi-r6c_UEFI_Release_v0.9.1.img of=/dev/mmcblk2 bs=1M

   Once that has been done the UEFI firmware should be visible via UART
   console or over HDMI after reboot:

   NanoPi-R6C UEFI Firmware screen 

   In Boot Manager You can select what device to boot from this time and in
   Boot Maintenance Manager You can configure permanent boot order.

   Keep in mind this example uses the image for R6C and you'll need the right
   UEFI image for R6S.

  Booting NixOS

   Since EDK2 UEFI firmware does not support extlinux an ISO aarch64 image
   needs to be used to successfully boot NixOS.

   Currently NixOS 23.11 images can see the NVMe without issues, but eMMC
   storage is unavailable.

  Installing NixOS

   A very basic partition layout could look like this:

 format() {
   DEV="${1}" # First argument is NVMe path.
   wipefs -a "${DEV}"
   parted -s --align optimal "${DEV}" -- mklabel gpt;
   parted -s --align optimal "${DEV}" -- mkpart 'EFI'  2MB   6GiB  set 1 esp on;
   parted -s --align optimal "${DEV}" -- mkpart 'SWAP' 6GiB  16GiB;
   parted -s --align optimal "${DEV}" -- mkpart 'ROOT' 16GiB '100%';
   parted -s --align optimal "${DEV}" -- print;
   mkswap    "${DEV}p2";
   mkfs.vfat "${DEV}p1";
   mkfs.ext4 "${DEV}p3";
 }

   Just call it it with format /dev/nvme0n1 and then mount your partitions:

 swapon /dev/nvme0n1p2
 mount  /dev/nvme0n1p3 /mnt
 mkdir /mnt/boot
 mount  /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot

   And you can continue with the installation as you normally would. A
   working bootloader configuration looks like this:

   boot.loader = {
     efi.canTouchEfiVariables = true;
     systemd-boot.enable = true;
     grub.enable = false;
   };
