Status

   Mostly working, but some manual steps needed to get it running.

Board-specific installation notes

    1. Flash the multiplatform ARMv7 SD card image onto a Micro SD card.
    2. Install the ODROID XU3 bootloader:
          * If you can run ARMv7 binaries (either natively or with QEMU), you
            can use nix-shell -p odroid-xu3-bootloader --run 'sd_fuse-xu3
            /dev/mmcblkp0' (replace mmcblkp0 with the device node for your SD
            card).
          * If you are cross compiling, the script will not run as it'll try
            to use ARMv7 binaries, but you can manually flash the needed
            parts:

     dd conv=notrunc bs=512 seek=1    of=/dev/mmcblk0 if=./result/lib/sd_fuse-xu3/bl1.bin.hardkernel
     dd conv=notrunc bs=512 seek=31   of=/dev/mmcblk0 if=./result/lib/sd_fuse-xu3/bl2.bin.hardkernel.1mb_uboot
     dd conv=notrunc bs=512 seek=63   of=/dev/mmcblk0 if=./result/lib/sd_fuse-xu3/u-boot-dtb.bin
     dd conv=notrunc bs=512 seek=2111 of=/dev/mmcblk0 if=./result/lib/sd_fuse-xu3/tzsw.bin.hardkernel

    3. If you cross compiled the boot loader, U-Boot will try to load an
       incorrect device tree blob. The easiest way to fix that is to mount
       the root partition (the second partition on the SD card), and modify
       boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf to include FDT exynos5422-odroidhc1.dtb
       (the HC1 and HC2 both use the same DTB file, there is no
       exynos5422-odroidhc2.dtb). This will be needed every time the
       configuration is regenerated, so it is best to reinstall the
       bootloader natively once the system has booted for the first time.

   The system is now ready to boot. SSH is disabled, so you'll need to access
   it via the serial port. As the image is based off of the NixOS installer
   you should be automatically logged into the nixos account and both nixos
   and root should have no password set.

Known Problems

  Hardkernel Kernel

   You can use the Hardkernel fork of the Linux kernel by setting
   boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackages_hardkernel_latest. Note that this
   is currently a 4.14 LTS kernel.

   This kernel does not reboot correctly with the default settings. To work
   around this you can set boot.consoleLogLevel = 7;. Powering the system off
   and then unplugging the power supply shortly to make it start up again
   also works.

  Mainline Kernel

   The mainline kernel also doesn't reboot correctly, but works fine when
   booted from a cold system. When doing a warm reboot the SATA port will not
   work and the ethernet port might also be unusable.

  Ethernet, SATA in stage1

   To use the SATA disk in stage1, for example to move the Nix store off of
   the Micro SD card, add boot.initrd.availableKernelModules = [ "uas" ];.

   To use a network connection, for example for remotely unlocking an
   encrypted root partition, add this to your configuration:

 boot.initrd.kernelModules = [ "r8152" ];
 boot.initrd.preLVMCommands = lib.mkBefore "waitDevice /sys/class/net/eth0";
