Board-specific installation notes

  Petitboot removal

   Petitboot is installed on the SPI memory of the Odroid HC4 from factory.
   To be able to load an upstreamed version of U-Boot without having to press
   a hardware button at each boot, you may remove it. Please proceed with
   caution, this will make Hardkernel images unbootable!

   From the Petitboot, go for “Exit to shell” and enter these commands to
   remove Petitboot:

 flash_eraseall /dev/mtd0
 flash_eraseall /dev/mtd1
 flash_eraseall /dev/mtd2
 flash_eraseall /dev/mtd3

   This will make your SPI flash memory empty and the device will now start
   from SD on next boot.

   See this Odroid forum topic to restore Petitboot.

  NixOS installation

    1. First follow the generic installation steps to get the latest stable
       installer image.
    2. Uncompress the .zst file. One may use the unzstd command (equivalent
       to zstd -d) on supported machines. The zstd commands can be accessed
       from the zstd package.
    3. Patch this image (.img file) with U-Boot for Odroid HC4.

 # Clone content of samueldr's wip/odroidc4 branch, edit the defconfig file, and build
 git clone https://github.com/samueldr/nixpkgs --depth 1 -b wip/odroidc4 && cd nixpkgs
 test "$(uname)" '==' 'Darwin' && sed -i '' 's/defconfig = "odroid-c4_defconfig"/defconfig = "odroid-hc4_defconfig"/' pkgs/misc/uboot/default.nix || sed -i 's/defconfig = "odroid-c4_defconfig"/defconfig = "odroid-hc4_defconfig"/' pkgs/misc/uboot/default.nix
 nix-build -I "nixpkgs=$PWD" -A pkgsCross.aarch64-multiplatform.ubootOdroidC4
 sudo dd if=result/u-boot.bin of=PATH/TO/nixos-sd-image-21.05.XXXX.XXXXXXXX-aarch64-linux.img  conv=fsync,notrunc bs=512 seek=1

    4. Flash the modified SD image file (.img) to a microSD card. This will
       erase all the data on the card!

Known issues

  Fan doesn't work by default

   You need to use software fan control (via fancontrol) for this. You may
   refer to [nixos-hardware Odroid HC4 module] for fancontrol configuration.

No HDMI audio by default

   After enabling ALSA you should see a sound card named "ODROID-HC4". Audio
   is not correctly routed by default so you might need to open alsa-mixer
   and change:

     * FRDDR_A SINK 1 SEL to OUT 1
     * FRDDR_A SRC 1 EN to on
     * TDMOUT_B SRC SEL to IN 0
     * TOHDMITX to on
     * TOHDMITX I2S SRC to I2S B

   After these changes, speaker-test -c 2 should output white noise.
