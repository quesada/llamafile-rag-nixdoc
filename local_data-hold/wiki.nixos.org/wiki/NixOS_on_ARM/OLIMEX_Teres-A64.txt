   Teres-1 (often referred as teres-a64) is an open-source hardware and
   software netbook design based on the Allwinner A64 SoC.

   OLIMEX Teres-A64
   The King Himself
   Manufacturer OLIMEX, Ltd         
   Architecture AArch64             
   Bootloader   Upstream U-Boot^[1] 
   Boot order   SD, eMMC            
   Maintainer   KREYREN             

   It can boot from SD or from the included and slow af eMMC module (insane
   people use only).

Status

   Stable, production-ready and suitable for mission critical environment

   For U-Boot use armbian's distribution as currently the nixos's version is
   outdated and broken

Installation instructions

  UEFI (recommended)

   Note: This method assumes that you have your bootloader flashed in eMMC or
   SPI

   Refer to the nixos.org download page and download the installer to your
   preference, then proceed to follow instructions in the NixOS manual on how
   to flash the installer on e.g. USB drive

  EXTLINUX (legacy)

   To use the generic installation image for your board, you will need to
   copy it verbatim to an SD card.

 sudo dd if=sd-image-aarch64-linux.img of=/dev/DEVICE conv=sync status=progress

   This board requires the installation of u-boot at a specific location on
   the storage where NixOS was written to.

 sudo dd if=u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/dev/DEVICE bs=1024 seek=8

Serial console

   Serial console can be accessed by default on BAUM 115200 using the
   TERES-USB-DEBUG cable (or make one it's 3 pole jack with pl2303 converter,
   can be made work off of single board computer, etc..) in headphone jack
   port and accessed through:

    $ picocom -b BAUD /dev/SERIAL-DEVICE # Often set as /dev/ttyUSB0 @ baud of 115200

   Currently the sdcard has set this by fault, but if you use custom
   configuration and want to maintain the serial console functionality then
   you need to append it to the kernel CLI through:

    boot.kernelParams = ["console=ttyS0,115200n8"];

  Kernels

    Downstream Kernel

   Note: Keep in mind that using non-upstream forks of the kernel always
   incurs some risk as far as security goes.

     This article or section needs expansion.                                 
     Reason: Find and document use of a kernel with the added capabilities.

     Please consult the pedia article metapage for guidelines on              
     contributing.                                                            

USB booting with U-Boot

   You will need to either have mainline U-Boot installed to the eMMC or to
   an SD card.

   Stop the boot process when prompted (by pressing a key). Then, do the
   following:

 Hit any key to stop autoboot:  0
 => setenv boot_targets usb0
 => boot

   This sets the boot order for this boot only. U-Boot can boot (among
   others) either of the NixOS sd-image or EFI iso from USB.

Notes

   Refer to the device's sunxi-linux wiki page for more details:
   https://linux-sunxi.org/Olimex_Teres-A64

   For u-boot installation refer to the u-boot documentation for AllWinner
   devices:
   https://docs.u-boot.org/en/stable/board/allwinner/sunxi.html#installing-on-a-micro-sd-card

   For TowBoot installation refer to the TowBoot wiki:
