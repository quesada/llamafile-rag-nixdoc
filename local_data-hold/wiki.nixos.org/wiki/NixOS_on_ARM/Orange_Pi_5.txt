                                  Orange PI 5

   The Orange Pi 5 is a Single-Board Computer with a Rockchip RK3588s SoC.

System configuration

   None of the basic components (Kernel, HW acceleration drivers) are
   available from upstream NixOS.

   Building a working system requires additional configuration.

  @ryan4yin's flake

   A minimal flake that makes NixOS running on Orange Pi 5:
   https://github.com/ryan4yin/nixos-rk3588

                                  Orange PI 5B

   The next version of OPI5 which added eMMC and WIFI/BT by default.

   Flake: https://github.com/fb87/nixos-orangepi-5x/blob/v5.10.x/flake.nix

   This flake which is extended version of ryan4yin by adding bootloader by
   default to create the bootable SDImage( The prebuilt
   https://github.com/fb87/nixos-orangepi-5x/releases/download/v0.1.0/nixos-sd-image-23.05.20230613.c702c94-aarch64-linux.img.zst
   can already be used).

   Note: bootloader requires `python2` which is no longer receiving updates
   since 2020. The `NIXPKGS_ALLOW_INSECURE=1` has to be passed in order to
   build.
