                                Orange PI 5 Plus

   The Orange Pi 5 Plus is a Single-Board Computer with a Rockchip RK3588
   SoC.

   Note that rk3588 is the same as rk3588s, but with more I/O pins (Linux
   device trees for rk3588 include rk3588s).

System configuration

   None of the basic components (Kernel, HW acceleration drivers) are
   available from upstream NixOS.

   Join `#nixos-on-arm:nixos.org` Matrix channel to hang out with users that
   are running this board. As of writing, here is an upstream PR for rk3588
   boards: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/292667

   As of writing, building a working system requires additional
   configuration.

  @ryan4yin's flake

   A minimal flake that makes NixOS running on Orange Pi 5:
   https://github.com/ryan4yin/nixos-rk3588

  What to do when bootloader breaks (SPI)?

   If you flash uBoot with incorrect bootloader, you may be unable to load
   anything else until uboot is fixed. Orange Pi 5 Plus supports maskrom mode
   with `rkdeveloptool`, as documented here:
