   The Orange Pi One is an Xunlong SoC based on the Allwinner H3. As the
   board is on the market for quite some time and the device is relatively
   cheap, the community effort resulted in a better than average mainline
   support with the current kernel (5.0). Refer to the H3 column in the SunXI
   Mainline Status Matrix.

   @dezgeg's porting efforts to ARMv7 works on the Orange Pi One, using the
   proper upstream u-boot.

   Even though the upstream uboot does support the Orange Pi One, it is not
   part of nixpkgs. However with the new cross-compiler toolchain added with
   nixpkgs-18.09 it is straight forward to build the bootloader yourself.

Board-specific installation notes

   First follow the generic installation steps to get the installer image on
   an SD card.

   U-Boot needs to be copied to specific sectors on the microSD card with dd.
   At first, build the u-boot for the device, then copy it to the correct
   location with (again, replace /dev/sdX with the correct path to the SD
   card device):

 nix-build -E 'let plat = ((import <nixpkgs> ){}).pkgsCross.armv7l-hf-multiplatform; in plat.buildUBoot{defconfig = "orangepi_one_defconfig"; extraMeta.platforms = ["armv7l-linux"]; filesToInstall = ["u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin"];}'
 sudo dd if=result/uboot-orangepi_pc_defconfig-2017.11.nixpkgs.*.u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/dev/sdX bs=1024 seek=8

   Then, install using the installation and configuration steps.

Serial console

   Your configuration.nix will need to add console=ttyS0,115200n8 to the
   boot.kernelParams configuration to use the serial console.

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 { config, pkgs, lib, ... }:
 {
   boot.kernelParams = [
     "console=ttyS0,115200n8"
   ];
 }

Compatibility notes

     * Ethernet works with 4.19 kernel
     * HDMI should work since kernel 4.17 (untested)
