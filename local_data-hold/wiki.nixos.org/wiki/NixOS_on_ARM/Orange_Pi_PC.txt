   @dezgeg's porting efforts to ARMv7 works on the Orange Pi PC, using the
   proper upstream u-boot.

   U-boot support has been merged 2017-12-11.

Board-specific installation notes

   First follow the generic installation steps to get the installer image on
   an SD card.

   U-Boot needs to be copied to specific sectors on the microSD card with dd.
   Download u-boot for the board
   (uboot-orangepi_pc_defconfig-2017.11.nixpkgs.*.u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin),
   and copy it to the correct location with (again, replace /dev/sdX with the
   correct path to the SD card device):

 sudo dd if=uboot-orangepi_pc_defconfig-2017.11.nixpkgs.*.u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/dev/sdX bs=1024 seek=8

   Then, install using the installation and configuration steps.

Serial console

   Your configuration.nix will need to add console=ttyS0,115200n8 to the
   boot.kernelParams configuration to use the serial console.

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 { config, pkgs, lib, ... }:
 {
   boot.kernelParams = [
     "console=ttyS0,115200n8"
   ];
 }

Compatibility notes

     * Using the upstream kernel at 4.13, neither HDMI nor Ethernet will
       work.
          * #29569 has a comment with a compatible linux kernel overlay
            derivation.
          * Support for ethernet may land in 4.15.
          * HDMI support isn't in the maintainer's requirements, it may start
            working in the future.
