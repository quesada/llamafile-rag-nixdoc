   Orange Pi Zero Plus2 (H5)
   An Orange Pi Zero Plus2 (H5).
   Manufacturer Xunlong / Orange Pi 
   Architecture AArch64             
   Bootloader   Upstream u-boot^[1] 
   Maintainer   

   Note: While made by the same manufacturer and using an Allwinner SOC, the
   H3 variant does not use the same architecture; this page does not relate
   to the H3 variant.

Status

   Upstream NixOS AArch64 image will boot on the Orange Pi Zero Plus2 (H5),
   using the proper upstream u-boot.

Board-specific installation notes

   First follow the generic installation steps to get the installer image on
   an SD card.

   U-Boot needs to be copied to specific sectors on the microSD card with dd.
   Download u-boot for the board, and copy it to the correct location with
   (again, replace /dev/sdX with the correct path to the SD card device):

 sudo dd if=u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/dev/sdX bs=1024 seek=8

   Then, install using the installation and configuration steps.

Wireless

   The wireless does not currently work using the upstream firmware from the
   firmware-linux-nonfree package. However there is a version of the firmware
   which does work in the Armbian firmware repository. See here for an
   example of how the firmware from this repository can be added to nixpkgs,
   such that it overrides the upstream files.

Compatibility notes

     * Using the upstream kernel at 4.18, HDMI does work currently.
