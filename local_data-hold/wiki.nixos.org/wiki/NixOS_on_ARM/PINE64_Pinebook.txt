   The Pinebook (sometimes referred as pinebook-a64) is a laptop design based
   on the Allwinner A64 SoC. It was available in two sizes, 11.6" and 14",
   but is now only available as 11.6". The 11.6" has two resolutions, first
   models had a 1366×768 panel, while the more recent ones have a 1920×1080
   panel.

   It can boot from SD or from an included and replaceable eMMC module.

Status

   Upstream NixOS AArch64 image boots on the PINE A64-LTS, using the proper
   upstream U-Boot.

   U-boot support has been added 2019-05-18. The bootloader has not been
   built for now.

Installation instructions

   To use the generic installation image for your board, you will need to
   copy it verbatim to an SD card.

 sudo dd if=sd-image-aarch64-linux.img of=/dev/DEVICE conv=sync status=progress

   This board requires the installation of u-boot at a specific location on
   the storage where NixOS was written to.

 sudo dd if=u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/dev/DEVICE bs=1024 seek=8

  Partitioning

   The internal storage needs to be partitioned in a way that that the
   bootloader will not interfere with nor be interfered by a partition.

   Then, continue installation using the installation and configuration
   steps.

    By copying the sd image internally

   This is an easy solution, that also allows booting and installing as one
   would from an SD card on a generic Allwinner platform. Simply dd the SD
   image to the internal storage. The internal storage is likely to be
   /dev/mmcblk2.

    MBR partition scheme

     This article or section needs expansion.                                 
     Reason: Installation instructions need to be written up to keep space    
     for embedding the bootloader to the SPL. (Discuss in Talk:NixOS on       
     ARM/PINE64 Pinebook#)

    GPT partition scheme

   The Allwinner/GPT Installation page explains how to create a GPT partition
   table while allowing the isntallation of u-boot at the required offset.

Serial console

   Details about the pinout for the headphone jack are available on the
   PINE64 wiki. It is also available on their store. The serial settings are
   the usual Allwinner settings.

   On early models^[Which?] serial needs to be toggled via software. On
   recent models, a physical switch is present on the main board. The
   linux-sunxi wiki's Pinebook page has details about serial access.

Compatibility notes

   Mainline kernel
   HDMI   * Hasn't been tested.   

  Downstream kernel

   Note: Keep in mind that using non-upstream forks of the kernel always
   incurs some risk as far as security goes.

     This article or section needs expansion.                                 
     Reason: Find and document use of a kernel with the added capabilities.

USB booting with u-boot

   You will need to either have mainline U-Boot installed to the eMMC or to
   an SD card.

   Stop the boot process when prompted (by pressing a key). Then, do the
   following:

 Hit any key to stop autoboot:  0
 => setenv boot_targets usb0
 => boot

   This sets the boot order for this boot only. U-Boot can boot (among
   others) either of the NixOS sd-image or EFI iso from USB.
