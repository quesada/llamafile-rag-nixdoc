   The Pinebook Pro is a laptop design based on the Rockchip RK3399 SoC.

   PINEBOOK Pro 
   A Pinebook Pro.
   Manufacturer PINE64 (Pine Microsystems Inc.) 
   Architecture AArch64                         
   Bootloader   U-Boot^[1]                      
   Boot order   SPI, eMMC, SD                   
   Maintainer   

   It can boot from SD or from an included and replaceable eMMC module.

Status

   Hardware support is partially complete and can be achieved using the
   overlay provided by nixos-hardware. A README with more information can be
   found into the specific device folder.

   You can also consider looking at previous work:

     * https://github.com/Thra11/nixpkgs-overlays-rk3399

   There is more information in the respective READMEs, but the gist of it is
   that those repositories can be used to build a system image either through
   cross-compilation or native aarch64-linux build, with the usual caveats.

   The repositories also serve as an overlay that can be used in your system
   configuration thereafter.

Board-specific installation notes

    1. Install the board-specific TowBoot to SPI
    2. Get the generic aarch64 sd-image and boot from it
    3. Just follow the normal installation procedure

Serial console

   Details about the pinout for the headphone jack are available on the
   PINE64 wiki. It is also available on their store. The serial settings are
   the usual Rockchip settings.

Compatibility notes

     * The keyboard may not send input when pressing mod4(pine key)+cursor
       combinations. This issue is resolved using the revised keyboard
       firmware.
