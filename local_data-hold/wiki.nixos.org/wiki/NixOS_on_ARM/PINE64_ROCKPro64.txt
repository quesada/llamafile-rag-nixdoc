   The ROCKPro64 is a powerful single board computer built around the
   Rockchip RK3399 SoC.

   PINE64 ROCKPro64
   A PINE64 ROCKPro64.
   Manufacturer PINE64 (Pine Microsystems Inc.) 
   Architecture AArch64                         
   Bootloader   Upstream U-Boot                 
   Boot options microSD, eMMC, SPI NOR Flash    

   There are two models of the board, with 2 or 4 GB of RAM. It can boot from
   an microSD card or an eMMC. It also has a 128 Mbit SPI flash that can be
   used to store the bootloader.

Status

   This board has upstream U-Boot and kernel support, although the mainline
   kernel may still be missing some features. NixOS can be installed using
   manual partitioning and nixos-install or by modifying the aarch64
   installation image as described in the next section.

   U-Boot for this board is packaged in nixpkgs, and Hydra builds can be
   found here:
   https://hydra.nixos.org/job/nixpkgs/trunk/ubootRockPro64.aarch64-linux

   It can also be cross compiled with

 nix-build '<nixpkgs>' --argstr system aarch64-linux -A ubootRockPro64 --out-link ubootRockPro64

Board-specific installation notes

   You can use nixos-aarch64-images to get an rockpro64 compatible disk image
   or running the commands manually as described below:

   U-Boot needs to be copied to specific sectors on the microSD card, eMMC or
   image with dd. Download/build U-Boot for the board, and write
   idbloader.img and u-boot.itb to the correct locations with (replace
   /dev/mmcblkX with the correct path to the card or image):

 dd if=idbloader.img of=/dev/mmcblkX conv=fsync,notrunc bs=512 seek=64
 dd if=u-boot.itb of=/dev/mmcblkX conv=fsync,notrunc bs=512 seek=16384

   Note: Prior to NixOS 20.03, a downstream version of U-Boot 2017.09 was
   packaged, which placed U-Boot in a single idbloader.img file. If that
   version is used, simply disregard the second command above.

   On many kernels, the ethernet driver cannot handle hardware check-summing
   of large packets, therefore this feature must be disabled for the ethernet
   to be stable. This can be done with the following NixOS configuration:

 networking.localCommands = ''
   ${pkgs.ethtool}/bin/ethtool -K eth0 rx off tx off
 '';

Serial console

   Note: Do not connect RxD (pin 10) until the U-Boot SPL is running (see
   [RK3399 boot sequence

   The ROCKPro64 uses a GPIO pinout compatible with the Raspberry Pi 2 and
   newer. This means that the following pins can be used to connect a serial
   adapter:

   Pi-2 Bus
   Pin Function 
   6   GND      
   8   UART0_TX 
   10  UART0_RX 

   See https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/ROCKPro64#GPIO_Pins for list of all pins

   The serial console runs at 1500000 baud in the bootloader.

   To connect check your dmesg for an identifier of the serial console:

 [78635.965459] usb 2-1: new full-speed USB device number 8 using xhci_hcd
 [78636.119008] usb 2-1: New USB device found, idVendor=1a86, idProduct=7523, bcdDevice= 2.63
 [78636.119017] usb 2-1: New USB device strings: Mfr=0, Product=2, SerialNumber=0
 [78636.119022] usb 2-1: Product: USB2.0-Serial
 [78636.127103] ch341 2-1:1.0: ch341-uart converter detected
 [78636.142043] usb 2-1: ch341-uart converter now attached to ttyUSB0

   In our example that coresponds to the ttyUSB0 which makes a new device
   available at /dev/ttyUSB0 to which you can connect using for (example)
   picocom:

 # Connect to /dev/ttyUSB0 at baud 1500000
 $ nix-shell -p picocom --run "picocom /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 1500000"

   See

   for more information on setting up the serial console
