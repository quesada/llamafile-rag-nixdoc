Status

     This article or section is out of date.                                  
     Reason: Section refers to old user-provided images. Should be reviewed   
     with cross-compilation, or native compilation through userspace          
     emulation. (Discuss in Talk:NixOS on ARM/PcDuino3 Nano)                  
     Once the page has been updated this notice can be removed.               

   @dezgeg's porting efforts to ARMv7 should work.

Board-specific installation notes

   First follow the generic installation steps to get the installer image.

   U-Boot needs to be copied to specific sectors on the microSD card with dd.
   Download U-Boot for the board
   (uboot-Linksprite_pcDuino3_Nano_defconfig-2015.07_u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin),
   and copy it to the correct location with (again, replace /dev/sdX with the
   correct path to the SD card device):

 sudo dd if=uboot-Linksprite_pcDuino3_Nano_defconfig-2015.07_u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/dev/sdX bs=1024 seek=8

   Then, install using the installation and configuration steps.

Serial console

     This article or section needs expansion.                                 
     Reason: The exact console parameter is needed. (Discuss in Talk:NixOS on 
     ARM/PcDuino3 Nano#)                                                      
     Please consult the pedia article metapage for guidelines on              
     contributing.                                                            

Notes about the boot process

   USB keyboards and HDMI displays work perfectly. Also a 3.3v serial port
   via the 3-pin header works.
