                                    Rock 5A

   The Rock 5A is a Single-Board Computer with a Rockchip RK3588s SoC.

System configuration

   None of the basic components (Kernel, HW acceleration drivers) are
   available from upstream NixOS.

   Building a working system requires additional configuration.
