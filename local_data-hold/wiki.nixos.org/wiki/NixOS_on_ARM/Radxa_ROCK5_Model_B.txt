   The Radxa ROCK 5B is a Single-Board Computer with a Rockchip RK3588 SoC.

     * CPU: ARM Cortex-A76 and Cortex-A55
     * GPU: Mali-G610 MP4
     * RAM: 4GB/8GB/16GB LPDDR4X at 2133MHz
     * MMC: eMMC Connector for up to 512GB
     * NET: 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet
     * USB: 2x USB 3.1 Type-A, 2x USB 2.0 Type-A
     * PCIe: M.2 Key E connector with PCIe 2.1 x1, M.2 Key M connector with
       PCIe 3.0 x4

Status

   Support of this system is YMMV (your mileage may vary), and depends on
   vendor-provided BSP (Board Support Package) based components.

   Two kinds of bootloaders are available in different variants:

     * U-Boot
          * Mainline - Supports all storage boot options, including NVMe
          * Vendor - Works well for eMMC and SD card boot, not for NVMe.
          * Not-TowBoot - Supports eMMC and SD card, NVMe sometimes.
               * Vendor U-Boot built using the TowBoot build infrastructure
     * EDK2/TianoCore
          * EDK2 UEFI Firmware - Supports all storage boot options, including
            NVMe.

   The official hardware documentation can be found on the Radxa wiki.

Bootloader Firmware

  Vendor U-Boot Firmware

   Booting the system with the vendor-provided platform firmware may not work
   due to a known issue in older U-Boot.

   If using the vendor-provided platform firmware is desired, renaming the
   kernel derivation to a shorter name should allow boot to succeed.

   Note: The Vendor Platform Firmware operates at the 1500000 baud rate. Your
   system may need to be configured to use 1500000 baud rate to make the
   serial console usable.

  Community UEFI Firmware

   The best available bootloader is EDK2 UEFI firmware for Rockchip RK3588
   platforms. The v0.9.1 release is confirmed working.

   In order to flash this bootloader we'll need to download two files:

     * rk3588_spl_loader_v1.15.113.bin - SPI bootloader image.
     * rock-5b_UEFI_Release_v0.9.1.img - UEFI bootloader image.

   Then use the rkdeveloptool tool in version 1.32 or higher as described in
   SPI flashing documentation:

  > nix-shell -p rkdeveloptool

 [nix-shell:~/rk3588]$ rkdeveloptool --version
 rkdeveloptool ver 1.32

 [nix-shell:~/rk3588]$ sudo rkdeveloptool db rk3588_spl_loader_v1.08.111.bin
 Downloading bootloader succeeded.

 [nix-shell:~/rk3588]$ sudo rkdeveloptool wl 0 rock-5b_UEFI_Release_v0.9.1.img
 Write LBA from file (100%)

 [nix-shell:~/rk3588]$ sudo rkdeveloptool rb

   Now the device has a graphical bootloader available when pressing Escape
   at boot time:

   Note: The standard NixOS SD card image supports only extlinux so ISO NixOS
   image needs to be used.

  Community U-Boot Firmware

   Note: This Platform Firmware operates at the 115200 baud rate. The 115200
   baud rate is more standard, so it may or may not need to be adapted to be
   usable.

   A WIP tree to build U-Boot using the infrastructure for Tow-Boot is
   available. (The end-result is not a proper Tow-Boot build.)

     * https://github.com/samueldr/Tow-Boot/tree/wip/rock5-vendor

   This uses a fork with some fixes, so that an installation on the SPI Flash
   will work, and allow OS booting from NVMe, eMMC or SD. NVMe support may be
   YMMV depending on the specific hardware.

   The board-specific README has further notes.

   Using from shared storage (SD, eMMC) or from SPI should work, and both are
   as supported.

   To build:

 nix-build -A radxa-rock5b

   The SD or eMMC shared storage image can be flashed as usual:

 dd if=shared.disk-image.img of=/dev/XXX bs=1M oflag=direct,sync status=progress

   The SPI image cannot be installed using the usual installer. For now you
   should follow the vendor instructions to write the
   binaries/Tow-Boot.spi.bin file to SPI. In other words using rkdeveloptool
   for the installation, or any other way to write to SPI flash.

System configuration

   A working bootloader configuration looks like this:

   boot.loader = {
     efi.canTouchEfiVariables = true;
     systemd-boot.enable = true;
     grub.enable = false;
   };

   The current NixOS 23.05 release with 6.1 Linux kernel detects NVMe but not
   the eMMC.

   Flash result to a new second legacy bootable ext4 partition on the
   installation media

   Boot into system:

 sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake github:jonahbron/config/aciceri-rebooted-into-this#rock5b
