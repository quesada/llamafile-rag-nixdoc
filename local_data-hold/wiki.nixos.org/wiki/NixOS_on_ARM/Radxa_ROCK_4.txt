   The @msgilligan PR below has been tested with both the ROCK 4B+ and ROCK 4
   SE variants.

Status

   Support of this system is YMMV (your mileage may vary).

   U-Boot bootloaders are available in different variants:

     * U-Boot
          * Mainline - Supports ?? boot options
          * Nixpkgs - not tested yet by @msgilligan

   The official hardware documentation can be found on the Radxa wiki.

Bootloader Firmware

  U-Boot Firmware

     * The @msgilligan PR rely's on `nixos-rockchip` which in turn uses the
       mainline U-Boot repository.
     * There is also support for ROCK 4 U-Boot in Nixpkgs, but testing and
       documentation for using this version of U-Boot is not available here
       yet.

System configuration

   Use the instructions in the README, but until the PR is merged, you'll
   need to checkout the PR branch.

   Use the following command to build the image:

 nix build .#RadxaRock4

   Nix flake for building several Rockchip SBC images, see GitHub

   and ROCK 4 SE): nabam/nixos-rockchip PR #27
