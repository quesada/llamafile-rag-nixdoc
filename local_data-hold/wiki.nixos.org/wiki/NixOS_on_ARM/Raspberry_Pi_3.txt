   ‚Üê Back to NixOS on ARM

   The Raspberry Pi family of devices is a series of single-board computers
   made by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. They are all based on Broadcom
   System-on-a-chip (SOCs).

   SoC          BCM2837B0               

Status

   The default Linux kernel in use, is the mainline Linux kernel, and not the
   Raspberry Pi Foundation's fork. This could reduce compatibility with some
   add-on boards or third-party libraries^[expanded explanation needed].

   The Raspberry Pi 3 Family is only supported as AArch64. Use as armv7 is
   community supported.

Board-specific installation notes

   First follow the generic installation steps to get the installer image and
   install using the installation and configuration steps.

   Warning: To avoid running out of memory and failing to build, it is
   advised to create a swap file (see e.g. [1]) before executing
   nixos-rebuild for the first time.

  Raspberry Pi 3B and 3B+

   Both the AArch64 and ARMv7 images boot out-of-the-box. Using the 64-bit
   AArch64 image is highly recommended, as the availability of binaries is
   much better and allows the use of the 64-bit instruction set.

   For the UART console, edit /extlinux/extlinux.conf on the main partition
   of the SD card to set console=ttyS1,115200n8 in the kernel boot
   parameters, making sure to replace the existing console=ttyS0,115200n8
   parameter. Use the following GPIO Pins with an USB-TTL connector:

 GND         - 3rd in top row, black cable
 GPIO 14 TXD - 4th in top row, white cable
 GPIO 15 RXD - 5th in top row, green cable

   Use nix-shell -p screen --run "screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200" (or nix run
   nixpkgs#screen -- /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 if you're using nix flakes) to
   connect to the console.

   Note: The mainline kernel (tested with nixos kernel 4.18.7) does not
   include support for cpu frequency scaling on the Raspberry Pi. To get
   higher clock speed, set force_turbo=1 in /boot/config.txt with
   boot.loader.raspberryPi.firmwareConfig

 {
   hardware.enableRedistributableFirmware = true;
   networking.wireless.enable = true;
 }

Tools

   The raspberry tools are available in the libraspberrypi package and
   include commands like vcgencmd to measure temperature and CPU frequency.

Audio

   In addition to the usual config, you will need to enable audio support
   explicitly in the firmwareConfig.

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

   sound.enable = true;
   hardware.pulseaudio.enable = true;

   boot.loader.raspberryPi.firmwareConfig = ''
     dtparam=audio=on
   '';

Serial console

   Your configuration.nix will need to add console=ttyS1,115200n8 to the
   boot.kernelParams configuration to use the serial console.

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 { config, pkgs, lib, ... }:
 {
   boot.kernelParams = [
     "console=ttyS1,115200n8"
   ];
 }

   If the Raspberry Pi downstream kernel is used the serial interface is
   named serial0 instead.

  Early boot

   Raspberry Pi 3's UART rate is tied to the GPU core frequency, set by
   default to 400MHz on Raspberry Pi 3 and later. This results in garbled
   serial output in bootloaders. Setting core_freq=250 in config.txt solves
   this issue (as per thread on the Raspberry Pi forum).

   It can be done declaratively as such:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 { config, pkgs, lib, ... }:
 {
   boot.loader.raspberryPi = {
     enable = true;
     version = 3;
     firmwareConfig = ''
       core_freq=250
     '';
   };
 }

   Note that this may have a negative impact on performance:

     Frequency of the GPU processor core in MHz. It has an impact on CPU
     performance because it drives the L2 cache and memory bus.

Bluetooth

   The bluetooth controller is by default connected to the UART device at
   /dev/ttyAMA0 and needs to be enabled through btattach:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 { pkgs, ... }:
 {
   systemd.services.btattach = {
     before = [ "bluetooth.service" ];
     after = [ "dev-ttyAMA0.device" ];
     wantedBy = [ "multi-user.target" ];
     serviceConfig = {
       ExecStart = "${pkgs.bluez}/bin/btattach -B /dev/ttyAMA0 -P bcm -S 3000000";
     };
   };
 }

Camera

   For the camera to work, you will need to add the following code to your
   configuration.nix:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 { config, pkgs, lib, ... }:
 {
   boot.loader.raspberryPi.enable = true;
   # Set the version depending on your raspberry pi.
   boot.loader.raspberryPi.version = 3;
   # We need uboot
   boot.loader.raspberryPi.uboot.enable = true;
   # These two parameters are the important ones to get the
   # camera working. These will be appended to /boot/config.txt.
   boot.loader.raspberryPi.firmwareConfig = ''
     start_x=1
     gpu_mem=256
   '';
 }

   Note: A reboot is required to load the new firmware configuration.

   To make the camera available as v4l device under /dev/video0 the
   bcm2835-v4l2 kernel module need to be loaded. This can be done by adding
   the following code to your configuration.nix:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 { config, pkgs, lib, ... }:
 {
   boot.kernelModules = [ "bcm2835-v4l2" ];
 }

Notes about the boot process

   It takes approximately 1 minute to boot a Pi 3B.

   USB keyboards and HDMI displays should work, though some issues have been
   reported (see Troubleshooting below).

   Using the 3.3v serial port via the pin headers (exact location depends on
   hardware version) will get u-boot output and, when configured, a Linux
   kernel console.

  Updating U-Boot

   These steps can be followed to update the platform firmware.

Troubleshooting

  Power issues

   Especially with the power-hungry Raspberry Pi 3, it is important to have a
   sufficient enough power supply or weirdness may happen. Weirdness may
   include:

     * Lightning bolt on HDMI output "breaking" the display.
     * Screen switching back to u-boot text
          * Fixable temporarily when power is sufficient by switching VT
            (alt+F2 / alt+F1)
     * Random hangs

   This problem is a hard problem. It is caused by the Raspberry Pi warning
   about power issues, but the current drivers (as of Linux 4.14) have a hard
   time dealing with it properly. If the power supply is rated properly AND
   the cable is not incurring too much power losses, it may be required to
   disable the lightning bolt indicator so the display driver isn't messed
   up.^[1] The lightning bolt indicator can be disabled by adding the line
   avoid_warnings=1 in config.txt^[2]

   Note: A properly rated USB power supply, AND a good cable are necessary.
   The cable has to be short enough to not incur power losses through the
   length. Do note that thin and cheap cables usually have thinner copper
   wires, which in turn accentuates power losses.

  WiFi / WLAN

   For a possible solution to 802.11 wireless connectivity issues, see:
   https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/82462#issuecomment-604634627

   In case wlan0 is missing, try overlaying an older firmwareLinuxNonfree
   confirmed to be working:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 { config, pkgs, lib, ... }:
 {
   nixpkgs.overlays = [
     (self: super: {
       firmwareLinuxNonfree = super.firmwareLinuxNonfree.overrideAttrs (old: {
         version = "2020-12-18";
         src = pkgs.fetchgit {
           url =
             "https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git";
           rev = "b79d2396bc630bfd9b4058459d3e82d7c3428599";
           sha256 = "1rb5b3fzxk5bi6kfqp76q1qszivi0v1kdz1cwj2llp5sd9ns03b5";
         };
         outputHash = "1p7vn2hfwca6w69jhw5zq70w44ji8mdnibm1z959aalax6ndy146";
       });
     })
   ];
 }

  HDMI

   HDMI issues have been observed on the 18.09 AArch64 image. The display
   would hang on "Starting Kernel...", then act as if the HDMI cable was
   unplugged. Re-plugging the HDMI cable after boot fixed the issue, as did a
   different monitor and HDMI cable.

    Early boot messages

   To show boot messages from initrd with the mainline kernel, add this to
   configuration.nix.

 {
   boot.initrd.kernelModules = [ "vc4" "bcm2835_dma" "i2c_bcm2835" ];
 }

  Raspberry Pi 3B+ HDMI output issues

     This article or section is out of date.                                  
     Reason: Since late 2019 the situation must have changed. Please test and 
     update this section. (Discuss in Talk:NixOS on ARM/Raspberry Pi 3)       
     Once the page has been updated this notice can be removed.               

   As of 2019/08/19, the u-boot build and kernel build can disagree about the
   name of the dtb file for the Raspberry Pi 3B+. This happens because the
   upstream filename has changed, and the built u-boot has hardcoded
   expectations for the filename to load.

   For now, do not use linuxPackages_latest, use the default linuxPackages
   which is the latest LTS, 4.19, which is known to be compatible.

   See [IMG] #66960.

  HDMI output issue with kernel ~6.1 (NixOS 23.05 or NixOS unstable)

   When using HDMI and hardware acceleration (e.g. Kodi), an application may
   fail to start and/or crash with a dmesg like:

 [232195.380745] [drm:vc4_bo_create [vc4]] *ERROR* Failed to allocate from CMA:
 [232195.380751] [drm]                         kernel:    432kb BOs (1)
 [232195.380755] [drm]                           dumb:  69064kb BOs (14)

 [317686.623998] [drm]                           dumb:  74752kb BOs (16)

   A workaround is to increase the pre-allocated CMA space (which, as of
   writing, defaults to 65M):

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 { config, pkgs, lib, ... }:
 {
   boot.kernelParams = ["cma=320M"];
 }
