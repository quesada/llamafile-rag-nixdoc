    This article or section needs expansion.                                  
    Reason: Explicit instructions for the C1 servers should be added, once it 
    is working. (Discuss in Talk:NixOS on ARM/Scaleway C1#)                   
    Please consult the pedia article metapage for guidelines on contributing. 

   NixOS historically had some support^[1] to work on Scaleway C1 servers. It
   may be possible to boot a C1 server using the approach described in
   Install NixOS on Scaleway X86 Virtual Cloud Server.

   At the time of writing (Dec 2017), that servers does not boot the NixOS
   kernel, although boot the kernel from
   http://mirror.scaleway.com/kernel/armv7l/4.9.67-mainline-rev1/ using
   instructions from Install_NixOS_on_Scaleway_X86_Virtual_Cloud_Server with
   the only difference in tags: instead of X86's:

 KEXEC_KERNEL=/boot/nixos-kernel
 KEXEC_INITRD=/boot/nixos-initrd
 KEXEC_APPEND=init=/boot/nixos-init

   There should be

 KEXEC_KERNEL=http://mirror.scaleway.com/kernel/armv7l/4.9.93-mainline-rev1/zImage
 KEXEC_INITRD=/boot/nixos-initrd
 KEXEC_APPEND=init=/boot/nixos-init

   It is to be investigated the difference between those kernels.
