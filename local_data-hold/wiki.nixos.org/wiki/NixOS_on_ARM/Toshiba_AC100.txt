     Once the page has been updated this notice can be removed.               

   It has been reported as working with @dezgeg's ARMv7 images by
   User:Roberth following these instructions.

Installation notes

   The Toshiba AC100 used to ship with Android 2, the fastboot bootloader and
   a custom partition table format. Nowadays, you can install U-boot on it.
   It is advisable to make a back-up (documented elsewhere; you'll need
   nvflash as documented below).

   In order to modify the operating system, you need to connect the AC100
   with a mini-usb cable to an Intel system we'll call the host. On the host,
   build the nvflash tool:

 pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
     name = "tegra-driver-package";
     version = "r16.5.0";
     src = pkgs.fetchurl {
       url = http://developer.download.nvidia.com/mobile/tegra/l4t/r16.5.0/ventana_release_armhf/Tegra20_Linux_R16.5_armhf.tbz2;
       sha256 = "11qmqj0yillwfapzcfjr4px4z8l7zkh0v3xrfpr9riff54xsidq2";
     };
     configurePhase = "";
     buildPhase = "";
     checkPhase = "";
     installPhase = ''
       mkdir $out
       cp -r * $out/
     '';
 }

   Build the nvflash tool and follow the instructions for installing U-boot
   starting with the getbct.sh step at
   https://paz00.ru/index.php/Migrate_to_U-Boot#With_prebuilt_sosuboot-tegra_archive_or_sdcard_image_.28PC_not_required.29

   When U-boot is installed, proceed with the sd-image-armv7l-linux.img image
   from https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/tmtynkky/nixos-arm/installer/ and follow
   the general NixOS installation instructions. If the first installation
   attempt fails, you will need to use the U-boot command line to select an
   alternative installation medium, using something like (please correct):

 setenv boot_targets=usb0
 run distro_boot
