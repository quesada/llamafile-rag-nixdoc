     This article or section is out of date.                                  
     Reason: Section refers to old user-provided images. Should be reviewed   
     with cross-compilation, or native compilation through userspace          
     emulation. (Discuss in Talk:NixOS on ARM/Wandboard)                      
     Once the page has been updated this notice can be removed.               

   @dezgeg's porting efforts to ARMv7 should work.

Board-specific installation notes

   First follow the generic installation steps to get the installer image.

   U-Boot and its SPL need to be copied to specific sectors on the microSD
   card with dd. Download U-Boot & SPL for the board
   (uboot-wandboard_defconfig-2017.03_u-boot.img,
   uboot-wandboard_defconfig-2017.03_SPL), and copy them to the correct
   location with (again, replace /dev/sdX with the correct path to the SD
   card device):

 sudo dd if=uboot-wandboard_defconfig-2017.03_SPL        of=/dev/sdX seek=1 bs=1k
 sudo dd if=uboot-wandboard_defconfig-2017.03_u-boot.img of=/dev/sdX seek=69 bs=1k

   Note: Only the Quad model has been tested, but the others should work as
   well with the same U-Boot binary.

   Then, install using the installation and configuration steps.

Serial console

     This article or section needs expansion.                                 
     Reason: The exact console parameter is needed. (Discuss in Talk:NixOS on 
     ARM/Wandboard#)                                                          
     Please consult the pedia article metapage for guidelines on              
     contributing.                                                            

Notes about the boot process

   Only serial console (via the DB-9 connector) is supported.
