    This article or section is out of date.                                   
    Reason: This page has not been updated for a long time (Discuss in        
    Talk:NixOS on MIPS)                                                       
    Once the page has been updated this notice can be removed.                

    This article or section needs expansion.                                  
    Reason: This topic can be expanded upon. While not a supported platform,  
    Nixpkgs and NixOS on MIPS can be a thing. Especially when using           
    cross-compilation. (Discuss in Talk:NixOS on MIPS#)                       
    Please consult the pedia article metapage for guidelines on contributing. 

   Warning: As of right now, NixOS does not have official support for MIPS
   even though parts of a previous support still reside in the nixpkgs

   The last state of setting up NixOS on MIPS is documented on in the old
   wiki on archive.org, however the documentation is horribly outdated and
   you will have a hard time reproducing the steps.

   Should you really want to try, the needed system tarball for the Fuloong
   mini-pc is distributed as a torrent

   This page is a place holder for the future support.
