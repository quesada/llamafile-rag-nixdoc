   The Core Nix Ecosystem is a collection of technologies designed to
   reproducibly build and declaratively configure and manage packages and
   systems as well as their dependencies. It achieves this by translating the
   functional paradigm from the program to the system domain by utilizing a
   dynamic, functional and lazy DSL called the Nix Language for specifying
   reproducible builds.

   In addition there are many other applications (Extended Nix Ecosystem)
   developed by the Nix community, utilizing and supporting these core
   technologies.

Usage of NixOS

   Users install the NixOS distribution on their computers just as any other
   Linux distribution. They read about packages to install and configuration
   options in Nixpgs via https://search.nixos.org and this wiki. They use the
   Nix language to declaratively describe in a text file what software
   packages should be installed and how the system should be configured. They
   run 2 command line programs in a terminal to transform the system into the
   described system. They use the system as any other Linux system.

Development of NixOS

   Developers of NixOS mainly work on Nixpkgs to describe in text files in
   Nix language how software packages should be build. After peer review
   these changes are integrated in Nixpkgs. Some of these packages are pre
   built on Hydra to reduce the update time for NixOS users.
