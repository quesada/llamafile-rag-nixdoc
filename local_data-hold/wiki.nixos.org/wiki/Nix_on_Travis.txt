   From NixOS Wiki

   Travis-CI provides a language: nix setting (to put in a .travis.yml file)
   to run continuous integration scripts on a machine with Nix installed.

   See Travis-CI documentation for Nix, Travis source code for Nix.

Caching dependencies

   Build dependencies are usually downloaded from some online public binary
   cache; but some dependencies are not available on such a cache and must be
   built on the CI machine on every run. It is however possible to reuse the
   result of such local builds from one run of the CI script to the next one
   by means of Travis CI caching feature.

   A Nix binary cache can be set up in a local directory (say ~/nix.store)
   which will be preserved between CI runs:

 cache:
   directories:
   - $HOME/nix.store

   Nix must then be configured to read from this local binary cache:

 before_install:
 - sudo mkdir -p /etc/nix
 - echo "substituters = https://cache.nixos.org/ file://$HOME/nix.store" | sudo tee -a /etc/nix/nix.conf > /dev/null
 - echo 'require-sigs = false' | sudo tee -a /etc/nix/nix.conf > /dev/null

   The first line ensures the directory holding Nix’s configuration files
   exists. The second line declares two binary cache: the main only hydra
   cache and the locally cached directory. The third line declares that
   cached closures need not be signed; indeed the local directory will not be
   signed.

   Finally, actual data must be stored in the cache:

 before_cache:
 - mkdir -p $HOME/nix.store
 - nix copy --to file://$HOME/nix.store -f default.nix buildInputs

   In this example, the buildInputs from default.nix are added to the binary
   cache.

   NB: in this setting, the cache only grows. It might be manually deleted
   when it becomes too bloated but smarter eviction strategies can be
   implemented too!

Enable sandboxed builds

   At the moment travis does not have a sandbox enabled by default. This can
   lead to non-trivial to reproduce errors, when files from the travis image
   interfere with the build. Enabling however is straight-forward by using
   the following little snippet:

 before_script:
   - sudo mkdir -p /etc/nix && echo 'sandbox = true' | sudo tee /etc/nix/nix.conf
