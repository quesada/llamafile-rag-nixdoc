   From NixOS Wiki

   nixos-anywhere is a tool for installing NixOS to a remote machine. It uses
   kexec to boot into a temporary ram based NixOS system. From there, it can
   use a tool called disko to erase and repartition an entire disk, and
   install NixOS.

   More information can be found on the official documents.

                                 Installing MBR

   The official documents recommend installing a GPT partition table, and
   installing an msdos partition table is not well supported, and there are
   no official examples. This is unfortunate, as many VPS do not use UEFI
   boot and are not over 4TB for the root partition. Additionally, on a VPS
   with limited disk space, it can be an unnecessary waste to create a
   separate partition for /boot.

   Fortunately, it is possible to install an msdos partition table in spite
   of the lack of support. With an msdos partition table, a bootable system
   can be made with only 1 partition, allowing utilization of all 100% disk
   space. Below is a simple example for installing a Btrfs root filesystem as
   the only partition on disk. If a swap partition is desired, it can be
   added after install, as Btrfs has support for live filesystem resizing.

 # disk-config.nix
 # Example to create a msdos partition
 { lib, ... }:
 {
   disko.devices = {
     disk.disk1 = {
       device = lib.mkDefault "/dev/sda";
 #      type = "disk";
       content = {
         type = "table";
         format = "msdos";
         partitions = [
           {
             part-type = "primary";
             fs-type = "btrfs";
             name = "root";
             bootable = true;
             content = {
               type = "filesystem";
               format = "btrfs";
               extraArgs = [ "-f" "-O block-group-tree" ];
               mountpoint = "/";
               mountOptions = [ "compress=zstd" ];
             };
           }
         ];
       };
     };
   };
 }
