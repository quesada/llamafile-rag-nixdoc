   This command analyzes your hardware configuration and generates two files
   of:

     * configuration.nix
     * hardware-configuration.nix

hardware specific notes

   If you are using an SSD it may be useful to enable TRIM support as well as
   set filesystem flags to improve the SSD performance:

 fileSystems."/".options = [ "noatime" "nodiratime" "discard" ];

   A collection of hardware specific platforms with their config can be found
   at NixOS Hardware repository
