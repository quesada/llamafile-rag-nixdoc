nixpkgs-dev mailinglist

   This is a mailing list where developers can contribute to nixpkgs without
   needing to go through GitHub, or requiring a GitHub account.

   View the mailing list here: nixpkgs-dev

  How does it work

   Submit a patch to nixpkgs using git send-email, see git-send-email.io for
   instructions.

   Reviews are handled through regular email replies. Once patches are
   accepted on the mailing list, a maintainer will open a PR on GitHub on
   behalf of the original author.

  Why?

   Sending patches over email has some advantages over web-based submissions
   like GitHub:

     * works with many different email clients and tools
     * doesn't require lots of bandwidth, or any persistent connection
     * allows for PGP signing of messages (you can't sign GitHub comments)
     * more open tooling
     * doesn't rely on any central authority

   And besides, not everyone uses GitHub, or likes to use GitHub. This
   mailing list is a alternative for those cases.
