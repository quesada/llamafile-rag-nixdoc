How it works

   To build deb/rpm packages with nix/nixpkgs, it is critical to understand
   the process. Hence a short intro:

   To build a deb or rpm package with nixpkgs, the build process needs a disk
   image which it then uses to boot a virtual machine (as in Qemu). Inside
   this virtual machine, the deb/rpm package is compiled from a tarball and
   then packaged using the respective tools for deb/rpm packaging.

   Luckily, all that requirements are shipped inside nixpkgs itself.

Preparation of the host machine

   The host machine has to be prepared for the build process.

   In the evaluation for this article, a CentOS 7 amd64 machine running in
   vmware was used. On the machine, the nix package manager was installed via
   curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh as suggested on
   https://nixos.org/nix/ > "Get Nix".

   The configuration file /etc/nix/nix.conf was edited for the following
   contents:

 sandbox = false
 system-features = [ kvm nixos-test benchmark big-parallel ]

   This step might not be necessary on a NixOS installation.

How to build a deb/rpm with nixpkgs

   The following approach can be used to try out building a .deb package with
   nixpkgs:

    1. Clone the official nixpkgs repository into ~/nixpkgs
    2. Add a file to the nixpkgs repository ./deb.nix with the following
       contents:

   (In this scenario, ncurses was built for testing the whole approach)

 let
   pkgs = (import ./default.nix {});
   vm    = pkgs.vmTools.diskImageFuns.centos7x86_64 {};
   args = {
     diskImage = vm;
     diskImageFormat = "qcow2";
     src       = pkgs.ncurses.src;
     name      = "ncurses-deb";
     buildInputs = [];
     meta.description = "No descr";
   };
 in pkgs.releaseTools.debBuild args

   and then this file was called: nix-build ./deb.nix.

   This loads the relevant disk images from the channel mirror and spins up
   the Qemu VM to build the package. The deb file (in this case, as we're
   building a deb with the expression from above) is located in
   ./result/debs/ after a successful build.
