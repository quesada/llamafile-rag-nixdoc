   Sometimes it may be required to patch a copy of Nixpkgs directly, rather
   than use an overlay to patch an individual package. One scenario of where
   this might happen is if Nixpkgs doesn't contain a change you need, but you
   find some existing PR that has yet to be merged, and so want to leverage
   those changes prior to them being merged.

   For the sake of example, let's say you are using the software package
   Ghidra, and the latest version available on Nixpkgs unstable is Ghidra
   11.1.2. You know that the Ghidra developers have recently released 11.2,
   and want to use it before it's in Nixpkgs. You could try to create an
   overlay and manually update the package, but maybe in the process you
   realize it is not a trivial update. You may find there is already a
   pending PR to Nixpkgs with the updated version and changes you want, such
   as this PR introducing Ghidra 11.2. If you didn't want to wait for this PR
   to be merged into Nixpkgs, you could apply the PR patch directly to your
   Nixpkgs instead. Which we will do below.

   There are of course other reasons you may wish to use a patched Nixpkgs
   and the method applies to any of those cases.

   First you will need to apply the Nixpkgs PR patch to some copy of Nixpkgs.
   In this example we will assume a Flake (flake.nix) that has an input
   nixpkgs-unstable pointing to nixos-unstable:

 inputs = {
     # ...
     nixpkgs-unstable.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
     # ...
 };

   We will use the applyPatches function to apply the unmerged PR changes to
   nixpkgs-unstable. First we need to covert the PR to a patch, which can be
   done by appending .patch to the github PR url. This will redirect to
   another link, for example
   https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/344917.patch will redirect to
   https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/344917.patch.
   We can use the latter.

     let
       pkgs-unstable' =
         (import nixpkgs-unstable {
           system = "x86_64-linux";
         }).applyPatches
           {
             name = "nixpkgs-unstable-patched";
             src = inputs.nixpkgs-unstable;
             patches = [
               (builtins.fetchurl {
                 url = "https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/344917.patch";
                 sha256 = "sha256-aws9J5ZNUyz4Z2RqPVEovBTNng4AdhzS03Bqg8jejWQ=";
               })
             ];
           };
       pkgs-unstable = import pkgs-unstable' {
         system = "x86_64-linux";
       };
     # ...

   In the above example we create a derivation with the patch applied, called
   pkgs-unstable'. We then import that new derivation which we assign to
   pkgs-unstable. Now we can use pkgs-unstable to access the Ghidra 11.2
   package, as well as any other packages normally available in nixpkgs.
