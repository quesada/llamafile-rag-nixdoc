   From NixOS Wiki

   https://noisemaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

   Right now nixpkgs contains tensorflow 2.1.0 but has it disabled for python
   3.8 (as it's not officially supported upstream either).

with tensorflow 2.3.0 from a branch

   Using nixpkgs from https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/95824 , you can
   update setup.py to change '==' versions to '>=' for the dependencies for
   which NixOS is shipping newer versions, and then use the following
   shell.nix:

 with import <nixpkgs> {};
 with python3Packages;

 buildPythonPackage rec {
   name = "noisemaker";
   src = /path/to/py-noisemaker;
   propagatedBuildInputs = [
     virtualenv
     pillow
     tensorflow_2
     click
   ];
 }

with tensorflow 2.3.0 from pip in a venv

   'python3 -m venv venv' doesn't seem to work with python 3.7, so I'm
   sticking with 3.8.

   noisemaker wants exactly version 6.2.0 of Pillow. The pillow in nixpkgs is
   a different version, so this will be fetched and built with setup.py. To
   make sure it can correctly find the C libraries it uses, we use fshUserEnv
   and add some development headers:

     { pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:
    
     let
       my-python-packages = python-packages: with python-packages; [
       ];
     in
     (pkgs.buildFHSUserEnv {
       name = "noisemaker";

       targetPkgs = pkgs: [
         (pkgs.python3.withPackages my-python-packages)
         pkgs.zlib.dev
         pkgs.libjpeg.dev
         pkgs.gcc
       ];
     }).env

   Then create noisemaker in a venv:

  $ python3 -m venv venv
  $ source venv/bin/activate
  $ python3 setup.py develop

   Add a newer tensorflow from pip:

 $ pip install tensorflow

   And run noisemaker:

 $ noisemaker

   (this will generate 'noise.png')
