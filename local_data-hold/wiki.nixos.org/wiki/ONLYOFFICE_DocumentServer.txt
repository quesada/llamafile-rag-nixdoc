   From NixOS Wiki

   ONLYOFFICE DocumentServer is a full-featured backend for editing different
   office documents like Open Document, Word, Excel, etc. online in your
   browser. The software is open source and can be easily deployed and
   integrated into existing server software. Available frontends are
   Nextcloud or the ONLYOFFICE CommunityServer. It can also be used in own
   software, see following examples for PHP, Node.js, etc.

Installation

   A minimal example to get a ONLYOFFICE DocumentServer running on localhost
   should look like this

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.onlyoffice = {
   enable = true;
   hostname = "localhost";
   jwtSecretFile = config.age.secrets.onlyoffice-jwt.path;
 };

Configuration

  Change default listening port

   In case port 80 is already used by a different application, or you're
   using a different web server than Nginx, which is used by the ONLYOFFICE
   module, you can change the listening port with the following option:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.nginx.virtualHosts."localhost".listen = [ { addr = "127.0.0.1"; port = 8080; } ];

  Caddy web server

   Warning: Onlyoffice is very particular about it headers and if there are
   some missing or different than what upstream expects, a seemingly
   completely unrelated portion of the software like font rendering can
   break. The module maintainer can only fully support nginx as this is the
   only webserver upstream supplies config files for in their docker image

   Instead of using the default Nginx web server, a configuration for Caddy
   might look like this

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.nginx.enable = lib.mkForce false;
 users.users.nginx = {
   group = "nginx";
   isSystemUser = true;
 };
 users.groups.nginx = {};

 services.caddy = {
   virtualHosts = {
     "office.example.org".extraConfig = ''
       reverse_proxy http://127.0.0.1:8000 {
         # Required to circumvent bug of Onlyoffice loading mixed non-https content
         header_up X-Forwarded-Proto https
       }
     '';
   };
 };

   The reverse_proxy configuration directly forwards all requests to the
   ONLYOFFICE server, ignoring the default Nginx vhost.
