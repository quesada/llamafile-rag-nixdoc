   OctoDNS is a powerful tool that allows for easy management of DNS records
   across multiple providers. It leverages Python to provide a unified
   interface for various DNS services, simplifying DNS administration tasks.

Installation

   Install OctoDNS with additional providers

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
   (octodns.withProviders (ps: [
     octodns-providers.bind
     octodns-providers.powerdns
     octodns-providers.hetzner
     octodns-providers.gandi
   ]))
 ];

Usage

   In this example we're going to configure the A record for the domain
   example.org which is managed by the provider Gandi

    

 config.yaml

 ---
 providers:
   config:
     class: octodns.provider.yaml.YamlProvider
     directory: ./config
     default_ttl: 3600
     # Records in the zone config don't have to be sorted alphabetically
     enforce_order: False
   gandi:
     class: octodns_gandi.GandiProvider
     token: env/GANDI_TOKEN

 zones:
   '*':
     sources:
       - config
     targets:
       - gandi

   Inside the directory config we're going to create a file with the DNS zone
   configuration for example.org

    

 config/example.org.yaml

 ---
 '':
  - type: A
    value: 8.8.8.8

   Apply this configuration to the domain

 GANDI_TOKEN=1234 octodns-sync --config config.yaml --doit
