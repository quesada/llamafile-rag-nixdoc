   From NixOS Wiki

   OneDrive is Microsoft's cloud file storage service. If you have a OneDrive
   account, for example from your organization or your Office 365
   subscription, NixOS has software to let you sync it to a OneDrive
   directory your home directory.

Setup

   Add the following to your /etc/nixos/configuration.nix:

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.onedrive.enable = true;

   and rebuild your system.

   Then as the user, run the following:

 onedrive

   You will be given a login URL, open it in your browser, log in to the
   appropriate Microsoft account to which your OneDrive account is linked to,
   and after you are logged in, you get an empty screen. This is good, just
   copy the URL you are redirected to and paste it back in the terminal.

   Then run the following:

 systemctl --user enable onedrive@onedrive.service
 systemctl --user start onedrive@onedrive.service

   this will enable and start the systemd user service. Note: this makes a
   symlink that is unmanaged by NixOS. When the onedrive service is updated,
   be sure to disable and enable the Systemd service again.

   Check that the service started successfully and is running:

 systemctl --user status onedrive@onedrive.service

   To view the log, run the following:

 journalctl --user -t onedrive | less

   .
