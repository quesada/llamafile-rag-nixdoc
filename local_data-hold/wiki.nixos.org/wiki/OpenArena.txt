   From NixOS Wiki

   OpenArena is an open-source fork of Quake 3 Arena.

  Firewall Configuration in NixOS for Local Games

   If you want to play OpenArena in a LAN setting (LAN-Party, Office
   Tournament) the game will not show locally hosted games. That is unless
   you allow the necessary UDP ports:

   networking.firewall.allowedUDPPorts = [ 27960 27961 27962 27963 ];
