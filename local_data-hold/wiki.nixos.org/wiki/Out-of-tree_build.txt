   From NixOS Wiki

   By default, stdenv.mkDerivation will run configure and make in the source
   root,
   but some projects require an out-of-tree build

   Example: the build script

 ./autogen.sh

 # out-of-tree build
 mkdir build
 cd build

 ../configure --enable-feature-a

 make

 make install

   can be translated to the Nix expression

 stdenv.mkDerivation {

   preConfigure = ''
     patchShebangs .
     ./autogen.sh

     mkdir build
     cd build
   '';

   configureScript = "../configure";

   configureFlags = [
     "--enable-feature-a"
   ];
 }
