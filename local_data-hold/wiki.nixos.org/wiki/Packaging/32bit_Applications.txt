Building software with 32bit gcc

   Question: I'm invoking gcc with -m32 and it fails to find `gnu/stubs-32.h`
   Answer (clever): you want to use pkgsi686Linux instead of pkgs, so things
   like pkgsi686Linux.stdenv.mkDerivation or pkgsi686Linux.callPackage then
   nix will give you 32bit everything^[1]

Building software with both 32- and 64-bit executables

   If a package wants to compile both 32/64-bit executables, you need a
   compiler with multilib support. Nixpkgs provides multiStdenv.mkDerivation
   that should be used instead stdenv.mkDerivation. This is equivalent to
   using gcc-multilib in debian derivatives.
