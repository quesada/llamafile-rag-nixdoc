   Paperless-ngx is a community-supported open-source document management
   system that transforms your physical documents into a searchable online
   archive, allowing you to reduce paper clutter.

Setup

   The following example configuration will enable Paperless locally

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 environment.etc."paperless-admin-pass".text = "admin";
 services.paperless = {
   enable = true;
   passwordFile = "/etc/paperless-admin-pass";
 };

   After applying the configuration you can access the instance via
   http://localhost:28981 and login with username admin and password admin.
   Another example below could be used on a server with an actual URL and
   some extra settings.

 services.paperless = {
   enable = true;
   consumptionDirIsPublic = true;
   address = "paperless.example.com";
   settings = {
     PAPERLESS_CONSUMER_IGNORE_PATTERN = [
       ".DS_STORE/*"
       "desktop.ini"
     ];
     PAPERLESS_OCR_LANGUAGE = "deu+eng";
     PAPERLESS_OCR_USER_ARGS = {
       optimize = 1;
       pdfa_image_compression = "lossless";
     };
   };
 };

   After the installation, you can set an admin user yourself via the
   following command on the server

 sudo /var/lib/paperless/paperless-manage createsuperuser
