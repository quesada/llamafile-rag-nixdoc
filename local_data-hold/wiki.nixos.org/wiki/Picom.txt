   From NixOS Wiki

   picom is a standalone compositor for Xorg, suitable for use with window
   managers that do not provide compositing. picom is a fork of compton,
   which is a fork of xcompmgr-dana, which in turn is a fork of xcompmgr.

Installation

   Put the following line into your system or home-manager config to install
   picom and enable it's service:

 services.picom.enable = true;

   If you just want to install picom without automatically running it every
   time your system boots, use this instead:

 packages.picom.enable = true;

Installing a custom fork

   Picom is known for having multiple forks, each having their own features
   such as animations, better performance or fixes that the most popular
   forks don't implement. Usually these forks are not available in nixpkgs.
   But with the following code you can compile and build custom versions from
   any source. Nurl can be used to generate fetch calls.

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
   (picom.overrideAttrs (oldAttrs: rec {
     src = fetchFromGitHub {
       owner = "pijulius";
       repo = "picom";
       rev = "da21aa8ef70f9796bc8609fb495c3a1e02df93f9";
       hash = "sha256-rxGWAot+6FnXKjNZkMl1uHHHEMVSxm36G3VoV1vSXLA=";
     };
   }))
 ];
