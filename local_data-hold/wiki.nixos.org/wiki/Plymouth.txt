   From NixOS Wiki

   Plymouth is an application that runs early in the boot process, providing
   a graphical boot animation, it is used by most desktop-oriented Linux
   distributions.

Usage

   As an example, you can use a boot animation from adi1090x's collection
   like so:

 configuration.nix

 { pkgs, ... }: {
   boot = {

     plymouth = {
       enable = true;
       theme = "rings";
       themePackages = with pkgs; [
         # By default we would install all themes
         (adi1090x-plymouth-themes.override {
           selected_themes = [ "rings" ];
         })
       ];
     };

     # Enable "Silent Boot"
     consoleLogLevel = 0;
     initrd.verbose = false;
     kernelParams = [
       "quiet"
       "splash"
       "boot.shell_on_fail"
       "loglevel=3"
       "rd.systemd.show_status=false"
       "rd.udev.log_level=3"
       "udev.log_priority=3"
     ];
     # Hide the OS choice for bootloaders.
     # It's still possible to open the bootloader list by pressing any key
     # It will just not appear on screen unless a key is pressed
     loader.timeout = 0;

   };
 }
