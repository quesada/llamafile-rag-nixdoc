   From NixOS Wiki

   So you'd like to present Nix or NixOS to a group or organization?

   Great, we have put together this page to help you get started!

   We considered putting together a canned presentation, and maybe we still
   will but we think it's more compelling when an individual presents a
   message that they really own. Ideally, users will see your presentation
   and leave feeling excited to try NixOS.

Purpose

   Begin by considering the purpose of your presentation:

     * Make it personal to you
     * Why do you want to give this presentation?
     * Why is giving the presentation important?

Compelling components

   Think about how you want to communicate the value or benefits of Nix:

     * Telling a story
     * Use the following needs to features framework:
    1. Situation that leads to a problem
    2. Implications of that problem, pain points
    3. How does Nix or NixOS take care of that problem
     * Live demos are exciting and compelling, but also risky, so be sure to
       practice and have contingency plans!

   Bonus idea: fold these ideas together into a single cohesive whole.

What to focus on

   When brainstorming your presentation, consider the following questions:

     * What's important about Nix to you?
     * What makes you excited about Nix?
     * What do you usually show others when showing them Nix?
     * When showing others Nix, what gets them excited?
     * What do they most like about Nix?

   Answers to these questions could include:

     * Reproducible Builds
     * Managing Dependency Relationships
     * Fearlessly making changes
     * Constant time rollbacks
     * Configuring from a single canonical location
     * Being part of something big, early
     * Building skills in Nix
     * Learning basic semantics of system management on an as-needed basis

Live demos

   The best live demos will be the unique ones you come up with yourself, but
   to get you started, we have a basic set of examples:

     * Vignettes in the Examples on nixos.org.
