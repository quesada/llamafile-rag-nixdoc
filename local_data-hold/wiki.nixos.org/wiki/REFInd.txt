   From NixOS Wiki

     rEFInd is a graphical boot manager for EFI- and UEFI-based computers,
     such as all Intel-based Macs and recent (most 2011 and later) PCs.
     rEFInd presents a boot menu showing all the EFI boot loaders on the
     EFI-accessible partitions, and optionally BIOS-bootable partitions on
     Macs. EFI-compatbile OSes, including Linux, provide boot loaders that
     rEFInd can detect and launch. rEFInd can launch Linux EFI boot loaders
     such as ELILO, GRUB Legacy, GRUB 2, and 3.3.0 and later kernels with EFI
     stub support. EFI filesystem drivers for ext2/3/4fs, ReiserFS, HFS+, and
     ISO-9660 enable rEFInd to read boot loaders from these filesystems, too.
     rEFInd's ability to detect boot loaders at runtime makes it very easy to
     use, particularly when paired with Linux kernels that provide EFI stub
     support.

   <nixpkgs/pkgs/tools/bootloaders/refind/default.nix>

   rEFInd cannot be used as-is to boot NixOS; there is no plumbing in NixOS
   allowing it to know about the generations. It can, though, be used as an
   intermediary, or secondary, bootloader to allow either selecting
   un-detected boot options or to help with recalcitrant UEFI
   implementations. Using it this way, NixOS is configured to setup any of
   its EFI bootloader as usual (grub, systemd-boot) and rEFInd should be able
   to detect those bootloaders in its default configuration.

Installation

   rEFInd can be installed either using the derivation built using nix or by
   downloading a pre-built binary. rEFInd can then be placed at the default
   bootloader location (or anywhere else and then configured) in the ESP.

   The default boot location is:

     * /EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI on the ESP for x64_64
     * /EFI/BOOT/BOOTAA64.EFI on the ESP for AArch64

  Text-mode Only

   Assuming the ESP is mounted at /boot/, a minimal installation (text-mode)
   without configuration can be made using nix this way (this will replace
   your default bootloader):

 $ sudo mkdir -p /boot/EFI/boot/
 $ sudo cp "$(nix-build '<nixpkgs>' --no-out-link -A 'refind')/share/refind/refind_x64.efi" /boot/EFI/boot/bootx64.efi

  Graphical

   If you have a fairly standard install and would like a full graphical
   installation with icons and buttons, the below will install refind to its
   own folder within your ESP:

 $ sudo nix-shell -p refind efibootmgr
 $ refind-install

Configuration

   A minimal hands-off configuration which allows some time to select an
   option follows:

 # Wait 2 seconds.
 timeout 2
 # Hide some stuff from the UI.
 hideui banner
 hideui hints

   rEFInd will, by default, remember the last booted option.

   The drivers_x64 folder can also be copied next to the rEFInd EFI binary to
   allow it to handle filesystems not handled by your EFI implementations
   (though this is untested).

 $ ls -l $(nix-build '<nixpkgs>' --no-out-link -A 'refind')/share/refind/drivers_x64

 -r--r--r-- 2 root root 73712 Dec 31  1969 reiserfs_x64.efi

   It may even be possible to use zfs when using the proper drivers.
