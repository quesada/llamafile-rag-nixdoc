   From NixOS Wiki
   (Redirected from Resource Overview)
   Note: Reference documentation and learning materials for using Nix
   standalone are maintained at nix.dev.

   This article is an overview of resources available both within the NixOS
   Wiki and elsewhere. For communication channels, support and information of
   contributing, see the community menu.

  Wiki - search by topic

   While most people just search for the article they want to read, there is
   also a way to reach almost all arcticles via 2 to 3 clicks from the
   starting page via the main 5 topic categories:

    1. Software
    2. Hardware
    3. Desktop - how to setup PCs
    4. Server - how to setup servers
    5. Community - people, communication, work on NixOS

  Wiki - search by article type

   The NixOS Wiki's core articles are divided into five type categories. Each
   category link will list all pages in that category:

    1. Pedias, for encyclopedic description
    2. Guides, for broad hands-on understanding and connections to other
       learning resources
    3. Tutorials, intended to teach a particular process or project
    4. Cookbooks, collections of tips and tricks
    5. Reference, full manuals and technical coverage

   Pages are also organized by the six most prominent components of the Nix
   Ecosystem — NixOS, Nix: the package manager, Nix: the language (Nix
   Expressions), Nixpkgs, NixOps and Hydra.

   Note: Home Manager is also a major community project to make user
   environment management in NixOS easier. It is intended to replace much of
   what you would do with nix-env, to reduce hard-to-track imperative
   actions.
