   Restic is a fast and secure backup program.

Installing

   Add restic to environment.systemPackages like so:

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
   restic
 ];

Security Wrapper

   If you want to back up your system without running restic as root, you can
   create a user and security wrapper to give restic the capability to read
   anything on the filesystem as if it were running as root. The following
   will create the wrapper at /run/wrappers/bin/restic

 users.users.restic = {
   isNormalUser = true;
 };

 security.wrappers.restic = {
   source = "${pkgs.restic.out}/bin/restic";
   owner = "restic";
   group = "users";
   permissions = "u=rwx,g=,o=";
   capabilities = "cap_dac_read_search=+ep";
 };
