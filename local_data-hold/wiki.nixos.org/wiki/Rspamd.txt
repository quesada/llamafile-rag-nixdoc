   Rspamd is a fast, free and open-source spam filtering system.

Installation

   To enable Rspamd add following line to your system configuration

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.rspamd.enable = true;

Configuration

  Bayesian spam training

   To enable bayesian spam training, enable a Redis instance and configure it
   in Rspamd as a backend

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.rspamd = {
   locals = {
     "redis.conf".text = ''
       servers = "${config.services.redis.servers.rspamd.unixSocket}";
     '';
     "classifier-bayes.conf".text = ''
       backend = "redis";
       autolearn = true;
     '';
   };
 };

 services.redis.servers.rspamd = {
   enable = true;
   # 0 disables listening to TCP ports and will only use unix sockets. Default
   # unix socket path is /run/redis-${name}/redis.sock thus
   # /run/redis-rspamd/redis.sock here.
   port = 0;
   user = config.services.rspamd.user;
 };

  Whitelist domain

   To whitelist a specific domain (in this example the domain example.org)
   which otherwise gets rejected by Rspamd for various reasons, this custom
   configuration override can be added:

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.rspamd = {
   enable = true;
   overrides."whitelist.conf".text = ''
     whitelist_from {
       example.org = true;
     }
   '';
 };

  DKIM key

   This module verifies the authenticity of emails through the analysis of
   DKIM signatures. In this example, we're configure a custom DKIM key file
   path suitable for the mailserver Maddy and adjust the group permissions
   for the Rspamd service.

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.rspamd = {
   enable = true;
   locals."dkim_signing.conf".text = ''
     selector = "default";
     domain = "example.org";
     path = "/var/lib/maddy/dkim_keys/$domain_$selector.key";
   '';
 };

 systemd.services.rspamd.serviceConfig.SupplementaryGroups = [ "maddy" ];

Tips and tricks

  Helper script to train rspamd

   The following example enables rspamd-trainer as a daemon which will run
   every 10 minutes to check for mails in the inbox of myuser@example.com
   which should be used for spam/ham training.

    

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 services.rspamd-trainer = {
   enable = true;
   settings = {
     HOST = "example.com";
     USERNAME = "myuser@example.com";
     INBOXPREFIX = "INBOX/";
   };
   secrets = [
     # Do not use this in production. This will make passwords
     # world-readable in the Nix store
     "${pkgs.writeText "secrets" ''
       PASSWORD = test123
     ''}"
   ];
 };

   The script will look into INBOX/report_ham and INBOX/report_spam
   respectivley for mails which will be feed into rspamd for training. After
   that they get moved to INBOX/learned_ham and INBOX/learned_spam. The
   report directories have to be created before that. You can do this using
   openssl:

 # openssl s_client -connect example.com:993 -crlf
 A login myuser@example.com test123
 A create "INBOX/report_spam"
 A create "INBOX/report_ham"
 A create "INBOX/report_spam_reply"
