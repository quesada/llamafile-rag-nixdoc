   From NixOS Wiki

   SSHFS is a file system that allows users to mount and access remote files
   over SSH (Secure Shell) connections, providing secure and encrypted access
   to remote data.

Configuration

   Following example configuration will mount the remote filesystem /mydata
   of the host 10.0.1.100 at the destination /mnt. Authentication is done via
   the user myuser and the private key /root/.ssh/id_ed25519.

 fileSystems."/mnt" = {
   device = "myuser@10.0.1.100:/mydata";
   fsType = "sshfs";
   options = [
     "nodev"
     "noatime"
     "allow_other"
     "IdentityFile=/root/.ssh/id_ed25519"
   ];
 };

     * Rclone, which also supports mounting via SFTP. Possibly a more robust
       and stable implementation.
