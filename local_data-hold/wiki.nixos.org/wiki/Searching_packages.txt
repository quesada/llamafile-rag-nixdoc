   From NixOS Wiki

   There are numerous approaches available for searching substrings within
   both package names and package descriptions in nixpkgs.

Using search.nixos.org website

   There is a web service to search with

           channel branches
              * Nix packages at search.nixos.org/packages
              * NixOS options at search.nixos.org/options
           flakes
              * packages at search.nixos.org/flakes?type=packages
              * options at search.nixos.org/flakes?type=options

   pros

     * easy to use
     * allows filters
     * nice GUI in browser
     * browser extensions possible (like @nixpgs as search engine in Firefox)

   cons

     * always requires Internet connection

Using the nix search command

   While this command requires flakes, you can use it to search for a
   package. It may be slow the first time, but further runs will use cached
   results.

 nix search nixpkgs firefox

   pros

     * fast
     * possible offline usage

   cons

     * requires disk space for caching
     * quite long command

Using the nix-env command

   It's possible to search for a package using nix-env -qaP

   pros

     * works offline

   cons

     * it's very slow and requires a lot of memory

Using the nix repl environment

   With the read–eval–print loop (REPL) of nix you can browse packages
   interactively.

   Starting the nix repl

 nix repl

 Welcome to Nix 2.18.2. Type :? for help.

 nix-repl>

   Loading the repository for nixpkgs

 nix-repl>

 nix-repl> :load <nixpkgs>
 Added 21181 variables.

   Type the first letters of a package

 nix-repl> neo

   Press Tab ↹ key for auto completion

Reverse search: searching which package provides a file

   There is third party programs nix-index, and rippkgs to find which package
   provides a given file. This is particularly useful when you are looking
   for a very specific file but you don't know which package installs it.
