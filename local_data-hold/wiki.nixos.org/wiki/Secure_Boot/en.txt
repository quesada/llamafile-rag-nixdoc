   Secure Boot usually refers to a platform firmware capability to verify the
   boot components and ensure that only your own operating system to boot.

   Secure Boot has multiple implementations, the most known one is UEFI
   Secure Boot, which relies on the UEFI platform firmware, but others
   implementations can exist on embedded systems.

   On NixOS, Secure Boot can be enabled via the project Lanzaboote.

   Lanzaboote has two components: lzbt and stub.

   lzbt is the command line that signs and installs the boot files on the
   ESP.

   stub is a UEFI application that loads the kernel and initrd from the ESP,
   it's different from systemd-stub, see below to see precise differences.

   Warning: Lanzaboote is still in development and requires some
   prerequisites and precautions. Currently it's only available for
   nixos-unstable. For more information, please see the GitHub repository or
   the Quick Start guide.

Requirements

   The Secure Boot implementation of Lanzaboote requires a system installed
   in UEFI mode together with systemd-boot enabled. This can be checked by
   running bootctl status:

 $ bootctl status
 System:
      Firmware: UEFI 2.70 (Lenovo 0.4720)
   Secure Boot: disabled (disabled)
  TPM2 Support: yes
  Boot into FW: supported

 Current Boot Loader:
       Product: systemd-boot 251.7
 ...

   It is recommended to enable a BIOS password and full disc encryption to
   prevent attacks against UEFI and Secure Boot.

Setup

   Follow the instructions in the Quick Start guide.

Key management

   At the time of writing, Lanzaboote offers only local storage of the
   keyring, otherwise, it is not possible to rebuild the system and sign the
   new resulting files.

   In the future, Lanzaboote will offer two new signature backends: remote
   signing (an HTTP server which receives signature requests and answers with
   signatures) and PKCS#11-based signing (that is, bringing an HSM-like
   device, e.g. YubiKey, NitroKey, etc.).

   Warning: Key management is a hard problem which is out of scope for
   Lanzaboote project, many recipes exist and there is no single perfect
   solution. Taking the time to learn how to key manage and figure out the
   right level of threat protection is crucial to achieve an effective boot
   protection.

Differences with `systemd-stub`

   systemd and distribution upstream have an existing solution called
   `systemd-stub` but this is not a realistic solution for NixOS as there's
   too many generations on a system.

   Using `systemd-stub`, a kernel and an initrd has to be duplicated for each
   generation, using Lanzaboote's stub, a kernel and initrd can be
   deduplicated without compromising on the security.

   Tracking the feature parity with `systemd-stub` can be done in this issue:
   https://github.com/nix-community/lanzaboote/issues/94.
