   From NixOS Wiki

   Slack is a communication platform with a desktop application based on
   Electron.

Installation

  NixOS

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ slack ];

Tips

  Wayland

   You can enable native Wayland support by launching Slack as:

 $ NIXOS_OZONE_WL=1 slack

   ... or by simply specifying this option globally:

 environment.sessionVariables.NIXOS_OZONE_WL = "1";

   If you want to use screen-sharing, you'll have to enable
   xdg-desktop-portal, too:

 xdg = {
   portal = {
     enable = true;
     extraPortals = with pkgs; [
       xdg-desktop-portal-wlr
       xdg-desktop-portal-gtk
     ];
     gtkUsePortal = true;
   };
 };

    Window decorations

   If the above configuration leaves you without window decorations you may
   want to enable this feature as well:

 WaylandWindowDecorations
