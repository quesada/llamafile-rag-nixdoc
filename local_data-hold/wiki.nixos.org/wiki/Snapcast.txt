   From NixOS Wiki

     Snapcast is a multiroom client-server audio player, where all clients
     are time synchronized with the server to play perfectly synced audio.
     It's not a standalone player, but an extension that turns your existing
     audio player into a Sonos-like multiroom solution. Audio is captured by
     the server and routed to the connected clients. Several players can feed
     audio to the server in parallel and clients can be grouped to play the
     same audio stream.

Pipewire Sink

   Both pulseaudio and pipewire can create a virtual audio sink that uses a
   FIFO queue to stream audio data into Snapcast.

   First create a local snapserver instance that creates the FIFO queue to
   stream into.

   services.snapserver = {
     enable = true;
     codec = "flac";
     streams = {
       pipewire  = {
         type = "pipe";
         location = "/run/snapserver/pipewire";
       };
     };
   };

   Then create a systemd user unit to attach the pipe-sink after pipewire has
   started.

   systemd.user.services.snapcast-sink = {
     wantedBy = [
       "pipewire.service"
     ];
     after = [
       "pipewire.service"
     ];
     bindsTo = [
       "pipewire.service"
     ];
     path = with pkgs; [
       gawk
       pulseaudio
     ];
     script = ''
       pactl load-module module-pipe-sink file=/run/snapserver/pipewire sink_name=Snapcast format=s16le rate=48000
     '';
   };

Playback

   To have local audio synced up with remote clients it needs to be routed
   through a local snapclient instance.

   systemd.user.services.snapclient-local = {
     wantedBy = [
       "pipewire.service"
     ];
     after = [
       "pipewire.service"
     ];
     serviceConfig = {
       ExecStart = "${pkgs.snapcast}/bin/snapclient -h ::1";
     };
   };
