   Note: This package is unfree and requires extra steps to install.

   SoftMaker Office is a proprietary office suite from SoftMaker
   (https://www.softmaker.com/en).

   It consists of programs for word processing (TextMaker); creating and
   editing spreadsheets (PlanMaker), slideshows (Presentations), and
   programming with BASIC (BasicMaker)

   Users buy a license for a given edition (let's say "2018") and can the
   install all versions of this edition (usually, each edition has multiple
   versions). This edition is eventually replaced by a newer one, for which a
   new license is needed. Users remain able to install older editions for
   which they acquired a license, but can't use newer editions with their old
   license.

   This guide explains how to install SoftMaker office.

   Note: With the current packaging (2021-05-28), it is not possible to
   install multiple editions (let's say 2016 and 2021) of SoftMaker Office
   simultaneously.

Installing the latest version (of the latest edition) of SoftMaker Office

  SoftMaker Office 2021; version: 1032

   As of 2021-05-28: edition: SoftMaker Office 2021; version: 1032

   Simply add softmaker-office to your system packages:

 environment = {
     systemPackages = with pkgs; [
         softmaker-office
     ];
 };

  SoftMaker Office 2021; version: 1064

 environment = {
     systemPackages = with pkgs; [
         (softmaker-office.override {
             officeVersion = {
                 edition = "2021";
                 version = "1064";
                 hash = "sha256-UyA/Bl4K9lsvZsDsPPiy31unBnxOG8PVFH/qisQ85NM=";
              };
          })
     ];
 };

  SoftMaker Office 2021; version: 1060

 environment = {
     systemPackages = with pkgs; [
         (softmaker-office.override {
             officeVersion = {
                 edition = "2021";
                 version = "1060";
                 hash = "sha256-cS+sDwN2EALxhbm83iTdu9iQe4VEe/4fo6rGH1Z54P0=";
              };
          })
     ];
 };

Installing a previous edition of SoftMaker Office

   You'll need to override the package configuration.

  Install SoftMaker Office 2018

    On NixOS 21.05

 environment = {
     systemPackages = with pkgs; [
         (softmaker-office.override {
             officeVersion = {
                 edition = "2018";
                 version = "982";
                 hash = "sha256-A45q/irWxKTLszyd7Rv56WeqkwHtWg4zY9YVxqA/KmQ=";
              };
          })
     ];
 };

    On NixOS 20.09

   Note: The only difference is the sha256/hash attribute.

 environment = {
     systemPackages = with pkgs; [
         (softmaker-office.override {
             officeVersion = {
                 edition = "2018";
                 version = "982";
                 sha256 = "A45q/irWxKTLszyd7Rv56WeqkwHtWg4zY9YVxqA/KmQ=";
              };
          })
     ];
 };

  Install other editions (2016)

   Note: This has not been tested yet, but should work.

   1. Go to https://www.softmaker.com/en/old-versions, and download the
   corresponding amd64 .tgz file (for Linux). Take note of the edition and
   version.

   2. Generate the sha256 hash (don't forget to fix the path and filename of
   the .tgz) :

 nix to-sri --type sha256 $(sha256sum ~/Downloads/softmaker-office-2018-982-amd64.tgz | cut -d ' ' -f1)

   3. Add the specification into /etc/nixos/configuration.nix as for
   installing the 2018 edition, and adapt the three variables with your
   values (edition, version and sha256).
