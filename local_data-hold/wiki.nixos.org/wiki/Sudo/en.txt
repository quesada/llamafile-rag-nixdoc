   Sudo allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain
   users - or groups of users - the ability to run commands as root or
   another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their
   arguments.

Usage

   Following simple configuration will allow all users which are part of the
   group wheel to execute commands specified inside extraRules as super user
   using sudo without the need to supply a user password.

 security.sudo = {
   enable = true;
   extraRules = [{
     commands = [
       {
         command = "${pkgs.systemd}/bin/systemctl suspend";
         options = [ "NOPASSWD" ];
       }
       {
         command = "${pkgs.systemd}/bin/reboot";
         options = [ "NOPASSWD" ];
       }
       {
         command = "${pkgs.systemd}/bin/poweroff";
         options = [ "NOPASSWD" ];
       }
     ];
     groups = [ "wheel" ];
   }];
   extraConfig = with pkgs; ''
     Defaults:picloud secure_path="${lib.makeBinPath [
       systemd
     ]}:/nix/var/nix/profiles/default/bin:/run/current-system/sw/bin"
   '';
 };
