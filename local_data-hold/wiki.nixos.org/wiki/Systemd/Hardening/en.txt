   ← Back to systemd

   Systemd's service options are quite lax by default, and so it is often
   desirable to look at ways to harden systemd services. A good way to get
   started on a given service is to look at the output of the command
   systemd-analyze security myService. From there, you can look at the
   documentation for the options you see in the output, often in man
   systemd.exec or man systemd.resource-control, and set the appropriate
   options for your service.

Accessing the network with a different RootDirectory

   To be able to access the network while having a RootDirectory specified,
   you need to give access to /etc/ssl, /etc/static/ssl and /etc/resolv.conf.
   The simplest way of doing this is by simply putting /etc in the
   BindReadOnlyPaths option. A more granular way, would be to put these 3
   paths into BindReadOnlyPaths, and wait for the creation of
   /etc/resolv.conf through a systemd.path unit.

Dropping a shell inside a systemd service

   While hardening a service, it often happens that you want a shell inside a
   hardened systemd unit, for exemple to check access to files, or check the
   network connectivity. One way to do this is to use tmux to create a
   session inside the service, and attaching to it outside of the service.
   Simple example:

 { pkgs, ... }:
 {
   systemd.services.myService = {
     serviceConfig = {
       ExecStart = "${pkgs.tmux}/bin/tmux -S /tmp/tmux.socket new-session -s my-session -d";
       ExecStop = "${pkgs.tmux}/bin/tmux -S /tmp/tmux.socket kill-session -t my-session";
       Type = "forking";

       # ...
     };
   };
 }

   Example with a RootDirectory specified:

 { pkgs }:
 {
   systemd.services.myService = {
     serviceConfig = {
       ExecStart = "${pkgs.tmux}/bin/tmux -S /run/myService/tmux.socket new-session -s my-session -d";
       ExecStop = "${pkgs.tmux}/bin/tmux -S /run/myService/tmux.socket kill-session -t my-session";
       Type = "forking";

       # Used as root directory
       RuntimeDirectory = "myService";
       RootDirectory = "/run/myService";

       BindReadOnlyPaths = [
         "/nix/store"

         # So tmux uses /bin/sh as shell
         "/bin"
       ];

       # This sets up a private /dev/tty
       # The tmux server would crash without this
       # since there would be nothing in /dev
       PrivateDevices = true;
     };
   };
 }

   To attach to the shell, simply execute tmux -S /path/to/tmux.socket
   attach.
