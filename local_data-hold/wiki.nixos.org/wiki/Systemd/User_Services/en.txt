   ← Back to systemd

   Systemd supports running a separate instance of systemd for a given user,
   allowing the user to control their own services. See here for more
   information: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd/User In NixOS, a
   user service can be expressed with systemd.user.services.<name>, as
   documented here:
   https://search.nixos.org/options?query=systemd.user.services This may be
   useful if you want a user to be able to start, stop, and restart their own
   instance of a service without needing to make the user a sudoer. Here is
   an example:

 systemd.user.services.my-cool-user-service = {
   enable = true;
   after = [ "network.target" ];
   wantedBy = [ "default.target" ];
   description = "My Cool User Service";
   serviceConfig = {
       Type = "simple";
       ExecStart = ''/my/cool/user/service'';
   };
 };

   By default, user services will be stopped when the user logs out and will
   start again when the user logs back in due to us setting wantedBy = [
   "default.target" ] in the example.

Keeping user services running after logout

   If you need a user service to stay running after a user logs out, you need
   to enable "lingering" by setting users.users.<username>.linger = true;
   You'll also likely want to change to wantedBy = [ "multi-user.target" ];
   so the service starts at boot time.
