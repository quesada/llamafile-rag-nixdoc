   logind is systemd’s login manager. Its main manual page is
   systemd-logind.service(8). Its configuration options are described in
   logind.conf(5).

Handling of power keys

   logind handles power and standby hardware switches. The Arch wiki has a
   good overview of which ACPI events are handled.

  Don’t shutdown on power button press

   When you use a laptop, often you don’t want an accidental short press of
   the power button to shut down your system. You can add the following
   snippet to your logind config:

 services.logind.extraConfig = ''
     # don’t shutdown when power button is short-pressed
     HandlePowerKey=ignore
   '';

   Long-pressing your power button (5 seconds or longer) to do a hard reset
   is handled by your machine’s BIOS/EFI and thus still possible.

  Ignore hardware keys when using systemd-inhibit

   systemd-inhibit allows you to put a lock on e.g. shutdown or sleep that is
   in place as long the given process is running. By default, the hardware
   key actions configured in logind override such inhibits. Say you want your
   laptop to stay awake when closing the lid in some circumstances, for
   example if you want to listen to music. If you start your lock screen with
   an inhibit on the lid switch systemd-inhibit --what=handle-lid-switch
   lock-screen-tool logind still overrides that user decision. For it to
   work, you need to tell logind to ignore the lid switch in your system
   config:

 services.logind.extraConfig = ''
   # want to be able to listen to music while laptop closed
   LidSwitchIgnoreInhibited=no
 '';
