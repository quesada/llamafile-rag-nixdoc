   Networkd-dispatcher is a dispatcher service for systemd-networkd
   connection status changes. This daemon is similar to
   NetworkManager-dispatcher, but is much more limited in the types of events
   it supports due to the limited nature of systemd-networkd.

Usage

   The following example triggers a script every time the networkd state
   routable or off is reached. This is the case when you connect to a new
   network or quit an existing connection as with OpenVPN. An additional
   check ensures that the affected interface corresponds to wlan0 and that
   the uplink is configured. After that the Tor daemon gets restarted.

 services.networkd-dispatcher = {
   enable = true;
   rules."restart-tor" = {
     onState = ["routable" "off"];
     script = ''
       #!${pkgs.runtimeShell}
       if [[ $IFACE == "wlan0" && $AdministrativeState == "configured" ]]; then
         echo "Restarting Tor ..."
         systemctl restart tor
       fi
       exit 0
     '';
   };
 };

   Please refer upstream documentation for available states and additional
   examples.
