   systemd-resolved is a systemd service that provides network name
   resolution to local applications via a D-Bus interface, the resolve NSS
   service (nss-resolve(8)), and a local DNS stub listener on 127.0.0.53. See
   systemd-resolved(8) for the usage.

Configuration

   The following configuration configures resolved daemon to use the public
   DNS resolver provided by Cloudflare. DNSSEC and DNS-over-TLS is enabled
   for authenticity and encryption.

 networking.nameservers = [
   "1.1.1.1"
   "1.0.0.1"
 ];

 services.resolved = {
   enable = true;
   dnssec = "true";
   domains = [ "~." ];
   fallbackDns = [
     "1.1.1.1"
     "1.0.0.1"
   ];
   dnsovertls = "true";
 };
