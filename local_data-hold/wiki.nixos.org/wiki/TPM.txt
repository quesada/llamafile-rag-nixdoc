   From NixOS Wiki

   TPM (Trusted Platform Module) is a secure microprocessor commonly embedded
   in modern computers. It can be used for boot chain audit, key storage and
   random number generation.

NixOS configuration

   A minimal NixOS configuration to be able to use the TPM from userspace can
   be:

 security.tpm2.enable = true;
 security.tpm2.pkcs11.enable = true;  # expose /run/current-system/sw/lib/libtpm2_pkcs11.so
 security.tpm2.tctiEnvironment.enable = true;  # TPM2TOOLS_TCTI and TPM2_PKCS11_TCTI env variables
 users.users.YOUR_USER.extraGroups = [ "tss" ];  # tss group has access to TPM devices

   After rebooting with this configuration, TPM2TOOLS_TCTI and
   TPM2_PKCS11_TCTI should point to device:/dev/tpmrm0 and your user should
   be able to read and write to /dev/tpmrm0.

Using a TPM2 with OpenSSH

   For example, the following commands create a new token associated with
   PIN-code YOUR_PIN (Personal Identification Number) and a recovery
   SOPIN-code YOUR_SOPIN (Security Officer Personal Identification Number)
   and then a new secp256r1 key:

 tpm2_ptool init
 tpm2_ptool addtoken --pid=1 --label=ssh --userpin=YOUR_PIN --sopin=YOUR_SOPIN
 tpm2_ptool addkey --label=ssh --userpin=YOUR_PIN --algorithm=ecc256

   Now you may show your public key:

 ssh-keygen -D /run/current-system/sw/lib/libtpm2_pkcs11.so

   To tell OpenSSH to use the TPM2 during login, you may add the following
   line to your ~/.ssh/config:

 PKCS11Provider /run/current-system/sw/lib/libtpm2_pkcs11.so

Frequently Asked Questions

  How does the PIN-code bruteforce protection work?

   You may run the following command to query the variable properties of your
   TPM:

 nix-shell -p tpm2-tools --run "tpm2_getcap properties-variable"

     * TPM2_PT_LOCKOUT_COUNTER is the current number of failed attempts,
     * TPM2_PT_MAX_AUTH_FAIL is the maximum number of failed attempts before
       lockdown,
     * TPM2_PT_LOCKOUT_INTERVAL and TPM2_PT_LOCKOUT_RECOVERY are durations in
       seconds for recovery.

  How to get TPM model information?

   The following command will dump found strings from the raw TPM2
   certificates:

 nix-shell -p tpm2-tools --run "tpm2_getekcertificate" | strings

   Usually, you may find a vendor such as STMicroelectronics or Infineon
   Technologies and a model such as ST33HTPxAHB61.

   To get firmware version information, you might want to look at:

 nix-shell -p tpm2-tools --run "tpm2_getcap properties-fixed"
