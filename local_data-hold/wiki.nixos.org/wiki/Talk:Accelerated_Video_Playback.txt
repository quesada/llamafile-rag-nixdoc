MPV

   The MPV manual discourages enabling HW acceleration in the config file,
   saying it can cause problems:

   In general, it's very strongly advised to avoid hardware decoding unless
   absolutely necessary, i.e. if your CPU is insufficient to decode the file
   in questions. If you run into any weird decoding issues, frame glitches or
   discoloration, and you have --hwdec turned on, the first thing you should
   try is disabling it.

   If one wants to set it in the config, they recommend hwdec=auto-safe, and
   say hwdec-codecs=all is just for testing purposes.

   Should we change the section in the page?
