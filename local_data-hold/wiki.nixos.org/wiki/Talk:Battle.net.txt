   This:

  (winetricks.override {
    wine = wineWowPackages.staging;
  })

   no longer works (NixOS 22.05):

  error: anonymous function at /nix/store/v039w5dpnfqy2qvqq04a489s8zqvr4di-source/pkgs/applications/emulators/wine/winetricks.nix:1:1 called with unexpected argument 'wine'
         at /nix/store/v039w5dpnfqy2qvqq04a489s8zqvr4di-source/lib/customisation.nix:69:16:
             68|     let
             69|       result = f origArgs;
               |                ^
             70|

   (It looks like winetricks doesn't need to be tied to a specific wine
   package anymore and will work with all versions)
