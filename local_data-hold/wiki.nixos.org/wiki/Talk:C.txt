   From NixOS Wiki

   (first contribution to the wiki)

   1) editing NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE_BEFORE_x86_64_unknown_linux_gnu was needed
   instead of NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE. 2) a link to an autotools documentation, or
   another wiki page on this subject, would be greatly appreciated. For
   instance, the wiki page of Gentoo
   https://devmanual.gentoo.org/general-concepts/autotools/index.html could
   help.
