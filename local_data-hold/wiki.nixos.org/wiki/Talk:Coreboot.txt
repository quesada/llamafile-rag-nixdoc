   Thanks for posting this. I followed the instructions however after the
   "... make crossgcc" step I get the following error:

   Welcome to the coreboot cross toolchain builder v6065f616eb (2020-10-28)

   Building toolchain using 1 thread(s).

   Target architecture is i386-elf

   WARNING No compatible Ada compiler (GNAT) found. You can continue without
   Ada support, but this will limit the features of coreboot (e.g. native
   graphics initialization won't be available on most Intel boards). ...

   I added gnat to the nix-shell step, however the same error message is
   displayed. I need native graphics initialization, so just checking whether
   someone else has experienced this and found a solution. I'll keep looking
   in the meantime.
