Where does the system cron job output go by default?

   I see the command printed by journalctl, but no output.

Link to different crontab manpage

   Latest comment: 14 October 20221 comment1 person in discussion

   The linked `crontab` man page doesn't match the `crontab` provided with
   NixOS; in particular, the nicknames (`@reboot`, `@daily`) are not
   supported by NixOS's `crontab`

 These special time specification "nicknames" are supported, which replace the 5 initial time and date fields, and are prefixed by the '@' character:

 @reboot    :    Run once after reboot.
 @yearly    :    Run once a year, ie.  "0 0 1 1 *".
 @annually  :    Run once a year, ie.  "0 0 1 1 *".
 @monthly   :    Run once a month, ie. "0 0 1 * *".
 @weekly    :    Run once a week, ie.  "0 0 * * 0".
 @daily     :    Run once a day, ie.   "0 0 * * *".
 @hourly    :    Run once an hour, ie. "0 * * * *".

   This link should probably be changed.
