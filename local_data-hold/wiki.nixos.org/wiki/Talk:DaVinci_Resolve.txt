AMD GPU not discovered

   I had to fix it with the following additions to configuration.nix

 hardware.opengl = {
   enable = true;
   extraPackages = with pkgs; [
     amdvlk
     rocmPackages.clr.icd
   ];
 };

   I'm not sure of the formal way nor the deeper workings of such drivers but
   the fix should be provided in the Wiki somehow in order to save people
   from the pain that I just went through :P
