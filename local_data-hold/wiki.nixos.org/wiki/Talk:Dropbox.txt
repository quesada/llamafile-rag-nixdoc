   From NixOS Wiki

   Using the code snippet mentioned here and after enabling the GNOME
   AppIndicator extension, I was able to get Dropbox to work on my system
   except for one thing: the AppIndicator cannot be interacted with. It will
   still correctly report sync status but I still have to use dropbox-cli to
   manage the systemd service.
