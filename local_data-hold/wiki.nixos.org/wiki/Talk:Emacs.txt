   There are a number of [issues][] related to wrapping Emacs too many times
   and the problems that ensue. This page suggests the use of both
   `pkgs.emacsPackagesFor` and `withPackages`, which will expose readers to
   these problems.

   If anyone here has experience with Emacs, please have a look at the "Tips
   and Tricks" section to see if you can somehow make the information more
   concise. It would be best if the code snippets under each section be
   combined into a single one, as to better organize the page. Layer-09
