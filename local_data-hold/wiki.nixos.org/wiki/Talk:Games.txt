Why list games?

   Latest comment: 20 October 20222 comments2 people in discussion

   Listing individual games on this page is misleading, giving the impression
   that only a handful of games work. I must've played about a dozen games on
   NixOS, native, via WINE, and via Steam. It works just as well as on Arch
   or Ubuntu; NixOS is in fact a great gaming platform. I'd vote to remove
   this list, or at the very least change it to only include games which
   explicitly require some kind of workaround.

   I agree this page should be deleted, most steam games runs without hack,
   and for other games, it's mostly the same logic of using steam-run or
   something like that, we don't need to list them one by one.

Using a games group

   I've been using a games group to handle permissions to adjust some limits
   (through gamemoderun usage from steam and lutris/wine)

   This is the excerpt of my config. In it's current form it might be helpful
   to some, but it requires some additional work before it can be added to
   the Wiki, like diving into the reasoning, and maybe explaining how to use
   `gamemoderun` on steam and/or other platforms.

   users.users.dietr1ch = {
     extraGroups = [
       "games"
     ];
   };

   programs = {
     gamemode = {
       enable = true;

       settings = {
         general = {
           inhibit_screensaver = 0;

           renice = 0;
           softrealtime = "auto";
         };
       };
     };
   };


   users.groups = {
     # Users that will play games
     "games" = {
       gid = 666;
     };
   };
   environment = {
     systemPackages = with pkgs; [
       gamemode
     ];
   };

   services = {
     udev = {
       extraRules = ''
         KERNEL=="cpu_dma_latency", GROUP="games"
       '';
     };
   };

   security = {
     sudo = {
       extraRules = [
         {
           groups = [
             "games"
           ];
           commands = [
             {
               command = "${pkgs.gamemode}/bin/gamemoderun";
               options = [ "NOPASSWD" ];
             }
             {
               command = "${pkgs.gamemode}/libexec/cpugovctl";
               options = [ "NOPASSWD" ];
             }
             {
               command = "${pkgs.gamemode}/libexec/gpuclockctl";
               options = [ "NOPASSWD" ];
             }
           ];
         }
       ];
     };

     pam = {
       # Higher resource limits. Used by Lutris/Wine.
       loginLimits = [
         { domain = "@games"; item = "nofile"; type = "soft"; value = "1048576"; }
         { domain = "@games"; item = "nofile"; type = "hard"; value = "1048576"; }
         { domain = "@games"; type = "-"; item = "rtprio"; value = 98; }
         { domain = "@games"; type = "-"; item = "memlock"; value = "unlimited"; }
         { domain = "@games"; type = "-"; item = "nice"; value = -11; }
       ];
     };
   };
