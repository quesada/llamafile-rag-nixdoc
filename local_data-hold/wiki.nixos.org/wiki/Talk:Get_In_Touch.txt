   Update nixOS Meetups with new meetups from meetup page

   I've removed a bunch of deleted meetups and noticed that there's a bunch
   of not listed meetups
   https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/find/?keywords=nixos&radius=Infinity

   Should they be added as well?

   The page is currently throwing all kinds of online communities into the
   same bucket called "Online". It would be helpful to point out the status
   of moderation, and whether they're official platforms. The idea here is
   not to kick anyone out, but make a clear distinction what can be expected
   from these platforms. Hexa (talk) 10:07, 23 May 2024 (UTC)Reply
