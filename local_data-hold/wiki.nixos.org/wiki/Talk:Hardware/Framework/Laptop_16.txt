improving the udev rule section

   Latest comment: 1 August2 comments2 people in discussion

   I would have liked to add a udev rule for the trackpad too, but did not
   manage to find a working rule. This is my WIP:

   ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="i2c", DRIVERS=="i2c_hid_acpi",
   ATTRS{idVendor}=="093a", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0274",
   ATTR{power/wakeup}="disabled",
   ATTR{driver/1-1.1.1.4/power/wakeup}="disabled"

   feel free to point out the error if you can find it. Betalars (talk)

           Saw this on the FW Discourse as well, and finally got around to
           taking a look. TL;DR: ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="hid",
           DRIVER=="hid-multitouch", ENV{HID_PHYS}=="i2c-*",
           ATTR{../power/wakeup}="disabled".
           I don't really trust that rule, though. I'm not confident that
           those are the best selectors to get to the right device, and I
           haven't really tested it beyond udevadm trigger -c add . seeming
           to work. I'd suggest you polish it further before updating this
           page. :)
           The issue with your approach is that the touchpad uses I2C instead
           of e.g. USB. I2C is considerably less sophisticated than USB, so
           it doesn't allow individual devices to wake the system. As such,
           the individual devices don't have a power/wakeup attribute to set,
           and the attribute is on the bus itself. Conveniently, in this
           case, the bus is just the parent directory in sysfs. AmyP (talk)
