   From NixOS Wiki

   The method described here seems deprecated, the GitHub repository
   https://github.com/blitz/tuxedo-nixos/?tab=readme-ov-file is abandoned,
   they suggest to use rs-tuxedo, https://github.com/AaronErhardt/tuxedo-rs

   In rs-tuxedo page there is a very simple process to installe it in nixos.
