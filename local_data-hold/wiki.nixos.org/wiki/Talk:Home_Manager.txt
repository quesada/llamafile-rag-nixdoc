   From NixOS Wiki

   Looks like the nixos module usage is different from that suggested in the
   documentation:
   https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.html#sec-install-nixos-module

   Why is that?

   > Why is that?

   @Onny Things changed, I guess. We should not document how to use
   independently developed software here. If you see NixOS wiki pages
   outdated w.r.t. official documentation, remove that information.
