   It's great that this page exists and that Immich is being packaged for
   NixOS. However, this page makes no reference to the source in nixpkgs. As
   far as i can tell, the most advanced state of packaging for Immich in
   NixOS is PR #324127 which is not merged yet, so it doesn't look like these
   instructions would currently work.

   Furthermore, it mentions multiple times "typsense" when the service used
   is typesense.

   Could we please fix these issues? :) Axx (talk) 12:29, 9 July 2024

           Agreed, this page needs to be more clear on the status of Immich.
           The original PR was closed months ago and a new one was opened. I
           changed the note slightly to point to the new PR V3ntus (talk)
