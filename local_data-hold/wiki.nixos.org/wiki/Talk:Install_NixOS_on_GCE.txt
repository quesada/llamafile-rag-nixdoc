   This guide appears to not work. When I followed it I get the following
   error from gcp when I "Create an image" :

   "Object not available. Either it does not exist or you do not have access.
   Try browsing for the object instead."

   I will write a disclaimer that says the guide is outdated and not working,
   please correct me if i'm wrong.

   Tubro: You're not wrong it is out dated and there is a new tool that is
   common across all clouds for this. Ideally we should have a tutorial on
   could shell like this one:

   https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/gitpod-io/openvscode-server&cloudshell_git_branch=docs&cloudshell_tutorial=guides/gcp-gce/cloud-shell-tutorial.md

   Which runs a markdown tutorial via a this command: `cloudshell_open
   --repo_url "https://github.com/gitpod-io/openvscode-server" --page
   "editor" --tutorial "guides/gcp-gce/cloud-shell-tutorial.md" --git_branch
   "docs" --force_new_clone`
