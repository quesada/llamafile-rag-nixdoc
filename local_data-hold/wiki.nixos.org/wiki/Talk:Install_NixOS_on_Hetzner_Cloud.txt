Include a dry step-by-step tutorial to create a VM on Hetzner

   Latest comment: 26 June3 comments2 people in discussion

   Hi! I recently created a tutorial about creating a new VM on Hetzner and
   installing NixOS on it. I published the tutorial on Reddit. Today I
   learned about this wiki, and I was thinking of moving the tutorial here.
   Here's the tutorial I did:
   https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/1dis8w4/from_scratch_vm_on_hetzner_using_hcloud_utility/.

   I noticed these words on the page: it would be neat to document how to
   boot from the NixOS ISO and create the machine based on an online
   description including https://github.com/nix-community/disko specs -
   should be a quick way to set up bespoke 'throwaway' machines.

   With one exception, e.g. having an online description (which I understand
   as a flake available online, for example as a repository on GitHub) - this
   is exactly what my tutorial covers.

   Would it be OK to directly include the tutorial on the page? It's kind of
   lengthy... If including it on this page is not quite OK, would a separate
   page be alright? I'm new to NixOS community and need a bit of guidance.

           I would love to have your tutorial here. I think its not too long
           it can fit in this page, just make a new heading and enter it
           here. It is always possible to restructure the content and move
           content to other pages. As the wiki is also for beginners it may
           be a good idea to add a short description how to morph the
           installed system in a system without flake usage after install? At
           least I prefer my Hetzner server this way ;-).
           It would be nice to have you as a regular contributor here. Just
           be respectful if you change other peoples content in a disruptive
           way: Talk about it first. Its a good way to use the user pages for
           this. There are often good reasons why something is written in a
           certain way, but often its just dumped information and people are
           happy if other people improve it. Klinger (talk) 19:02, 19 June

                        With minor edits, I've ported the tutorial from
                        Reddit. Kindly, please review if / when you have
                        time. I tried to keep the balance between adding step
                        explanations while also keeping it compact.
                        > morph the installed system in a system without
                        flake usage after install?
                        Interesting idea. I haven't done this before. In my
                        humble opinion, I'm for keeping the tutorial
                        reasonably small and opinionated, so that newcomers
                        are able to follow it & get a working OS without
                        thinking too much. Perhaps, a separate step-by-step
                        that doesn't use flakes would also be "cleaner"?
                        Although I that would be partially replicating what
                        the official NixOS documentation does. Oldhomemovie
