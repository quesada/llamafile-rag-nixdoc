testing 2022-03-26 Install NixOS on Hetzner Online#Bootstrap from the Rescue
System

           nixos-generate -o /home/foo/result -f kexec-bundle -c
           /home/foo/config.nix

   fails

   trying

           nixos-generate -o /home/foo/result -f kexec -c
           /home/foo/config.nix

   works

testing 2024-10-10 Install NixOS on Hetzner Online#Bootstrap from the Rescue
System

   I tested using nix-env -f
   https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-generators/archive/1.8.0.tar.gz -i
   -v

           nixos-generate -o /root/result -f kexec-bundle -c /root/config.nix

   fails

Rename article?

   I just deleted a large section about bootstrapping NixOS on Hetzner Cloud.
   The header of this article specifically mentions that Hetzner Online and
   Hetzner Cloud are two different services, and that this article deals with
   Hetzner Online's dedicated servers.

   I'm thinking that it might be worth making this more clear by renaming the
   article title – the distinction between Online/Cloud IS confusing, and the
   title could do better. Maybe "Install NixOS on Hetzner Online (Dedicated
   Servers)" or "NixOS on Hetzner Online Dedicated Servers" to allow for
   expanding the article to cover any other specifics for this provider.

nixos-anywhere

   https://github.com/numtide/nixos-anywhere worked very well for installing
   NixOS on a EX101 dedicated server. If anyone wants to expand this article
   ...

2023-07-08: kexec and kexec-bundle are currently broken in nixos-generate
