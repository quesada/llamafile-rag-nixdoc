   It turns out if your current distro won't allow CLONE_NEWNS, then you
   can't use the chroot method to install nixos. --Kim Bruning (talk) 20:23,

   I know this page is outdated, but even at the time it was created:
   Shouldn't it be supposed to configure boot? Or is it supposed to be
   explained in another page? It say to reboot and hopefully hop into Nix,
   but the chroot part don't seem to configure boot at all. If I'm not
   missing anything, it won't boot at all? --Bphd (talk) 12:17, 10 October
