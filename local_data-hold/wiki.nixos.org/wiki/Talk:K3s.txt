Move nixpkgs documentation to the wiki

   Latest comment: 6 June2 comments2 people in discussion

   @Superherointj: Instead of deleting the content from the wiki and
   referring to nixpkgs, how about we do the reverse and move the content
   here, with a link from the repo README? The wiki is better for
   discoverability, especially via search engines. Also, IMO the wiki is
   where all user documentation should eventually reside together in a
   central place. Sdht0 (talk) 15:42, 6 June 2024 (UTC)Reply

           Currently the single source of truth for K3s docs is at nixpkgs.
           It was agreed by K3s maintainers:
           https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/313252
           https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/314395
           It's preferable to point to current information over keeping stale
           information. Currently it is not planned to duplicate information.
           But effort has been put into improving K3s docs at nixpkgs.
           Users can still contribute to Wiki, to be eventually integrated to
           K3s docs at nixpkgs. Or to contribute directly to K3s docs at
           Nixpkgs, if they feel the need. Superherointj (talk) 19:49, 6 June
