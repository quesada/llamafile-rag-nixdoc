   How do I install KDE apps? For example, Ark?

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   You add this to your configuration.nix

 environment.systemPackages = [
   pkgs.libsForQt5.ark
 ];

           plasma5Packages.ark or plasma packages should be used instead of
           some qt. Sandro (talk) 07:18, 25 June 2024 (UTC)Reply

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   I’ve updated the example on how to exclude packages as a response to the
   warning it produced in NixOS 23, but maybe it would’ve been better to have
   separate sections for the different NixOS versions? Or is there another
   way to indicate the difference? And how do I know what version this change
   was introduced in?

           We only really want to support the latest, none EOL NixOS version
           and Plasma 5 will be dropped soonish, anyway. Sandro (talk) 07:17,

                        How long will Plasma5 be in Nixpkgs? Klinger (talk)

                                     It will be probably gone by 25.05, maybe
                                     already for the 24.11 release but
                                     nothing set in stone yet. Sandro (talk)
