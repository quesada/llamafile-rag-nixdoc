Watch for SPICE support in Apache Guacamole

   Latest comment: 20 April 20231 comment1 person in discussion

   https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-261 If this comes to
   fruition, this could streamline the guide to setting up SPICE via web
   browser, probably reduces attack surface area a lot. (Could be a risky
   proposition to expose SPICE to the internet directly, via websocket...) —
