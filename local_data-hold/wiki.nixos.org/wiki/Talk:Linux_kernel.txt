Warning for the section about disabling mitigations?

   Latest comment: 26 August 20192 comments2 people in discussion

   I think that showing users how to disable security features should come
   with some warning. Users that are not familiar with these mitigations
   might copy and paste this configuration without considering the security
   implications. Also I don't think it's a good idea to have the
   configuration take the command line from the web page, as the web page
   might change. --Pingiun (talk) 16:16, 26 August 2019 (UTC)Reply

           Good call, just removed it, while still leaving the useful parts
           of the section.

Custom Extra Settings

   They are not working without Overrides.

Why is the default kernel (just `linux`) not the latest?

   Latest comment: 9 August 20201 comment1 person in discussion

   Why does the default kernel is just `linux`, and why is it old? It's
   currently 5.4 on both 20.03 and unstable. I'd expect it to be updated in
   unstable at least.

   It looks like it's the LTS version of the kernel?

           As you found out by your last sentence, the default Linux package
           set is set to the latest LTS released at the time the next stable
           version of NixOS is forked off. This is important because the
           latest non-LTS version of Linux may be EOL'd before our next
           release happens! As this is a stable branch, we don't want to
           rudely upgrade such a critical package from under the user's feet.

Build kernel from source and use it

   Latest comment: 24 January 20231 comment1 person in discussion

   I'm working on the linux kernel, so I need to build a kernel from
   kernel.org with my changes and run it. I have no clue about how to do this
   on NixOS. I come from Arch Linux, and their documentation for what I want
   to do is here:
   https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel/Traditional_compilation. It would
   be awesome if the this page included instructions like that for NixOS.

   --FranciscoKurpiel (talk) 23:11, 24 January 2023 (UTC)Reply

specify pkgs.linuxKernel.packages.* instead of what's currently there

   The reader, from what I can tell, does not know to add pkgs.linuxKernel to
   the kernel option.
