GNOME power saving suspension

   Latest comment: 6 August 20221 comment1 person in discussion

   How to neatly "add gnome-session-inhibit to the beginning of the Exec=
   line in mpv.desktop"? It looks like this is expected to be implemented by
   the user rather than built into MPV.

script option in mpv unwrapped

   for some reason the lambda dislikes the script arg when I applied the
   overlay code for the overlay from the wiki example. I haven't had time to
   dig into it but would be nice if someone has a fix if they could update
   the wiki or let me know if more debug info is needed
