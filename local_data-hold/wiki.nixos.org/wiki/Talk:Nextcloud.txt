Removing "Adding missing indices" section?

   Since https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/308291 has been merged, would
   it be okay to remove this section? PopeRigby (talk) 22:06, 24 May 2024

Does ONLYOFFICE really require the ONLYOFFICE app?

   Latest comment: 11 September1 comment1 person in discussion

   I was under the impression that the richdocuments app can deal with any
   WOPI client. It's a bit confusing right now because NextCloud seems to be
   pushing hard for Collabora. So everything is currently being rephrased in
   a why that seems to indicate you can only use Collabora with NextCloud
   Office (which is really richdocuments). Britter (talk) 13:02, 11 September
