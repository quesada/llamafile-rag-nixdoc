   What if this article was structured like
   https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide, adapting as
   needed?--Isa (talk) 18:56, 9 July 2021 (UTC)Reply

post-installation recommendations

   The arch wiki has something similar to this, where it outlines what you
   should do after install. It would be beneficial to have something similar
   on this article or on another article

   For example, enabling display managers, enabling a desktop environment,
   where to find packages and options, etc.

Partitioning and formatting sections are confusing

   For example, for the boot sector it just says +500M, this would be
   familiar to someone used to fdisk. But someone who isn't doesn't even know
   what unit it is might assume they're just meant to add 500 to 2048 and
   write 2548. This is an easy fix(probably by using code blocks).
