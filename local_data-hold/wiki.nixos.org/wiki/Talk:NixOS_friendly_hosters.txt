Classification of Hosters

   Latest comment: 30 September 20203 comments3 people in discussion

   Currently, the classification of hosters does not seem to be consistent.
   To pick one example, the entry for Vultr says: Vultr has a 19.09 NixOS ISO
   in its public ISO library and also allows the upload of custom ISOs. If
   that is the only kind of support they offer, I certainly would not
   describe that as ‚Äú1st class‚Äù. You cannot immediately log in to a new
   machine via SSH. You still have to install NixOS and configure basic stuff
   like network and SSH yourself. This is basically the same story as for
   Hetzner Cloud. Yet Vultr is classified as 1st class NixOS support, while
   Hetzner Cloud is classified as Support NixOS via custom ISO.

   Compare this to vpsFree.cz. I haven't tried it myself, but according to
   their documentation, they have a VM image or template for NixOS, and they
   deploy your SSH key automatically. This way you you should be able to spin
   up a VM with NixOS and log in with SSH right away.

   If no one has any objections, I will revise this page in the coming days.
   I propose a new tier system:

   Tier 1
           Ready-made VM image, automatic deployment of network configuration
           and SSH keys.

   Tier 2
           Does not fulfill conditions for tier 1, but a current, stable ISO
           image is available.

   Tier 3
           Does not fulfill conditions for tier 1 or tier 2, but allows
           upload of custom ISOs by the user.

   Tier 4
           Does not fulfill conditions for tiers 1, 2, or 3, but customer
           support will upload ISOs if requested.

   Unknown
           There is reportedly some NixOS support, but the specific nature of
           that support is unclear.

   The last category is needed, because I don't want to remove any of the
   hosters already listed. But it‚Äôs not in all cases apparent in what way the
   hoster in question supports NixOS.

   I am fine with the tiers you proposed üëç --Fadenb (talk) 14:14, 30

Outdated/Unclear status of Scaleway

   "There is a image proposal to add full NixOS support." The repository was
   deleted and beside a commit from 2016 in "kernel-tools"
   (https://github.com/scaleway/kernel-tools/commit/5dde5bc3f7c08c88dd2a2a3661a9dff35479316b)
   I can't find anything related to NixOS in the whole Scaleway-Organisation
   on GitHub.
