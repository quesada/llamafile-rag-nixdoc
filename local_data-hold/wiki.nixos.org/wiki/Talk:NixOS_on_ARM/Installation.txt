Build SD-card images based on u-boot specific defconfig

   Latest comment: 13 September1 comment1 person in discussion

   While trying to build an SD image for a `BananaPi-M2-Berry` I got almost
   immediately stuck, because [this
   article](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/NixOS_on_ARM/Banana_Pi) just starts
   with how to build `u-boot` out of the blue, without providing any context
   how this would relate to any `img` one might need. The "next step" refers
   [here](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/NixOS_on_ARM#NixOS_installation_.26_configuration),
   which essentially tells me that if I'm on a standard `aarch64` device I
   can download an image, if not ... _<looks for banana pi, finds link and
   clicks it>_ ... and we're back at the `u-boot` page.

   It would be cool if we'd have a brief explanation how we can actually make
   a booting SD card image based on `u-boot`. I'm starting to understand (?)
   that the way forward might be something that overrides a
   `pkgs.ubootSomething.override { defconfig = "bananapi_m2_berry_defconfig";
   }` and then somehow use `populateFirmwareCommands` to copy the outputs of
   that derivation to some intermediate `firmware/` directory???

   Then there's the question what to do about `.dts` files? The one that
   seems to be necessary in this case (`sun8i-v40-bananapi-m2-berry.dtb`) is
   actually available within the rource of `u-boot`
   (`./arch/arm/dts/sun8i-v40-bananapi-m2-berry.dtb`), so we can/should copy
   it as well with `populateFirmwareCommands`? How? Where? (And looking at
   the `armbian` image for this device, I noticed there is no separate
   `FIRMWARE` partition. How does that relate to this?)

   Does anyone have an idea how this is supposed to work? I guess the nice
   thing is that if some actual context would be available, we would have all
   `u-boot` supported systems instantly covered with an actual actionable
   recipe? Ppenguin (talk) 13:57, 13 September 2024 (UTC)Reply
