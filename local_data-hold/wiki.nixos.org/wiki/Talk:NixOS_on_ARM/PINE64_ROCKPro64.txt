     Note: It is not recommended to connect the serial adapter to pin 10 (RX)
     while booting, as this often causes the board to hang early in the
     bootloader. Disconnecting pin 10 still allows the serial console to be
     viewed, and it can be reconnected after the board boots, allowing
     interaction with the console.

   Was this observed using the Pine64 USB Serial Console? I have a different
   make of USB-serial adaptor and haven't noticed any such issues. Is it
   possible this is a quirk of a specific serial adaptor rather than an issue
   with the RockPro64 itself? (Or maybe it's been fixed in u-boot or
   something?) Thra11 (talk) 12:32, 22 August 2019 (UTC)Reply
