   < Talk:NixOS on ARM

   When trying to build a raspberrypi1 image i came across the section about
   "arm6 image works", however it is entirely unclear how to build or where
   to get this image. in nixpkgs there is
   nixos/modules/installer/sd-card/sd-image-raspberrypi.nix which should
   build a raspberrypi image like this: nix-build nixos -I
   nixos-config=nixos/modules/installer/sd-card/sd-image-raspberr ypi.nix -A
   config.system.build.sdImage. enabling arm6 cross-compiling, however is
   also a topic not further described in the nixos-on-arm super-page.
