   Latest comment: 3 April by Riot in topic Enabling the SPI

   I am a bit confused here, it seems like there is a lot of valueable
   information, but it hard to follow. Can someone help me clear it up,
   please?

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   About which image to use it says:

   First follow the generic installation steps to get the installer image and
   install using the installation and configuration steps. (Link to
   https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/NixOS_on_ARM#Installation which itself links
   to
   https://hydra.nixos.org/job/nixos/release-20.03/nixos.sd_image.aarch64-linux)
   Until the generic image works, a temporary device-specific image is build
   on Hydra. Note that this image is not using u-boot, but rather the
   Raspberry Pi specific bootloader configuration. (Link to
   https://hydra.nixos.org/job/nixos/trunk-combined/nixos.sd_image_raspberrypi4.aarch64-linux)

   Only the later link gave me an image that would boot on my RP4(4GB)

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   There is also this line: "These configurations will boot (from this PR
   comment):" But then no configurations do follow.

Viable Pi 4 (B) image(s)

   (The confusion around working images is compounded by the fact that Hydra
   offers identically-named downloads have non-identical contents, and the
   underscore/hyphen nomenclature varies wildly. It took me a while to
   confirm that the file I'd downloaded matched the build link below.)

   ...

   Currently, build #149338044 has worked twice on my Pi 4 (B) hardware. My
   usage is command-line only (Bash on TTY + ssh/mosh headless use), and the
   first run was stable for about three or four weeks of daily-ish use.

   ...

   To be quite honest, I'm not sure how I found that specific working image.

   I know my path led past here, which is why I'm posting, but I know it
   involved a lot of negotiating with Hydra's willingness to purge
   long-running queries and finding a way to list successful
   sd_image_new_kernel.aarch64-linux builds (maybe via this query?. Following
   that logic has been somewhat of a mixed bag, eg today I've unsuccessfully
   attempted to get both build #154444353 and build #154444322 to run.

Enabling the SPI

   Latest comment: 3 April1 comment1 person in discussion

   This section is confusing, mostly because it has factual errors and i
   can't get it to work. For starters, it talks about dtsoFile =
   ./spi0-0cd.dtso;, which should probably be dtboFile = ./spi0-0cs.dtbo;
   (note the dtbo and cs part, the page mentions dtso and cd) - at least that
   is my idea, if i look at the link's (below) target, which is
   https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/blob/master/boot/overlays/spi0-0cs.dtbo

   Also, it is unclear on how one should change the compatible field in a
   dtbo-file - editing is only possible on their corresponding source files -
   while the text actually mentions dtbo here ;)

   I've adapted my configuration to this but don't get any spi devices (nor
   does spi appear in dmesg). I'm also wondering wether using
   boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackages_rpi4; is still relevant (it is
   mentioned in nixos-hardware-issues/565) while some other user claims that
   "using nixos-hardware wasn't necessary anymore" (nixos-hardware/issues/631
   - maybe unrelated)

   It would probably help, if someone knowledgeable can verify these
   instructions and in general clarify the confusions i mentioned.

   Thanks in advance, Riot (talk) 21:44, 3 April 2024 (UTC)Reply
