           The wording used makes it hard to know whether it is supposed to
           work or not

   It supposed to work (at least ```nixpkgs``` already has ```scaleway-c1```
   among ```platform```s). But it does not work with recent kernels. It seems
   that the kernel should be compiled with different options. This requires
   further investigations, comparing config of the Debian's kernel with
   NixOS's, etc Volth (talk) 23:42, 2 January 2018 (UTC)Reply

           Thanks, I'm investigating booting a C1 scaleway host right now,
           I'll update the page with the current status. --samueldr (talk)

   Also NixOS on Scaleway ARM64 is blocked by inability to boot those servers
   (actually KVM virtual machines on 96-core Cavium) with custom kernel
