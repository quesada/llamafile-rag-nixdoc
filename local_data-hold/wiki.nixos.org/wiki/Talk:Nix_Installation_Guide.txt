   From NixOS Wiki

   I have just added a clarifying header that refers back to more official
   documentation here, because I had a first-time user follow the
   instructions on this page to install Nix.

   I think it's a better idea to first follow the instructions in the
   official docs and resort to this wiki to fill the gaps.

   IMO Nix has a bit of a problem with documentation being so fragmented and
   I think linking relevant official sources is a good measure to take for
   improving that situation.

   Let me know what you think about this.
