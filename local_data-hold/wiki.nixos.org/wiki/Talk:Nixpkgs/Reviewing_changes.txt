How to review sub-packages?

   Latest comment: 13 September1 comment1 person in discussion

   I can use an overlay to review the entire set of python3Packages, but I'm
   unsure how I would test for example just this patch. Simply setting
   python312Packages.pymupdf = self.review.python312Packages.pymupdf;, for
   example, results in errors "attribute 'pip' missing" and "attribute
   'python' missing".
