   Idea originally suggested by Makefu on 14:04, 12 September 2017 (UTC) in
   Talk: Alternative Package Sets.Reply

   I think it would be a great place to start it by introducing the plethora
   of override methods and the overlay mechanism (what else?) in a high level
   as a historical narrative by explaining what problems they were trying to
   solve (or any other rationale) and what shortcomings they have (had) that
   required the introduction to the next tool down the line.

   All the tools mentioned will be linked to their own page.

   For example:

    1. tool 1 (we had to keep doing x manually or duplicate existing Nix
       expression so we came up with this BUT we ran into issues with so we
       came up with tool 2)
    2. tool 2 (this was much nicer because of reasons BUT still had the
       shortcomings of z. Which is why introduced the overlay mechanism)
    3. overlays (the ultimate, case closed, etc.)
