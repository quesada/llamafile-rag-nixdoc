     * the rust manual link is not valid and the Rust nightly overlay points
       to Mozilla's nixpkgs fork (from @fricklerhandwerk on Matrix)

     * The Python Packages Overlay uses a recursive set, and "pythonPackages
       = python.pkgs;" instead of "pythonPackages = self.python.pkgs;"
       Doesn't that mean that if a later overlay further modifies the
       "python" key, then " pythonPackages = python.pkgs;" will still see the
       earlier version? About the dangers of "rec" in overlays:

     * Overriding of Go packages is needed, because it's not obvious.
