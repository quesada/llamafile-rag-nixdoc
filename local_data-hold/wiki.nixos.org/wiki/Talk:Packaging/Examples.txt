   I really like the idea to have such page, however i think each example
   should be fleshed out a bit with exaplanation which points towards the
   quirks which were needed to package the software.

   e.g. for minecraft we patchelf the binaries because there is no source
   code and finally use makeWrapper to add all the required binaries in the
   PATH and add the required libraries via LD_LIBRARY_PATH. there is also
   some googleapps wrapper stuff going on which is just above my knowledge
   why this is necessary in first place --Makefu (talk) 12:27, 29 April 2020
