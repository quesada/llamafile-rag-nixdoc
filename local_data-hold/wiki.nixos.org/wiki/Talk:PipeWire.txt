   Latest comment: 10 May by Akaihola in topic Wireplumber configuration
   example discrepancies

       - The option definition `services.pipewire.config' in `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix' no longer has any effect; please remove it.
       Overriding default Pipewire configuration through NixOS options never worked correctly and is no longer supported.
       Please create drop-in files in /etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/ to make the desired setting changes instead.

Wireplumber configuration example discrepancies

   Latest comment: 10 May3 comments1 person in discussion

   The configuration examples for wireplumber have confusing differences
   compared to Wireplumber Bluetooth configuration documentation. For example
   this one on the wiki page:

 environment.etc = {
         "wireplumber/bluetooth.lua.d/51-bluez-config.lua".text = ''
                 bluez_monitor.properties = {
                         ["bluez5.enable-sbc-xq"] = true,
                         ["bluez5.enable-msbc"] = true,
                         ["bluez5.enable-hw-volume"] = true,
                         ["bluez5.headset-roles"] = "[ hsp_hs hsp_ag hfp_hf hfp_ag ]"
                 }
         '';
 };

   The differences are:

    1. Instead of bluez_monitor.properties,
       Wireplumber documentation uses monitor.bluez.properties.
    2. Instead of ["bracketed.and.quoted.property.names"],
       Wireplumber documentation uses plain.property.names.
    3. Instead of ending each property line with a comma (... = true,),
       Wireplumber documentation omits the comma (... = true).

           Ah, Pipewire configuration format changed between versions 0.4 and
           0.5, and NixOS 23.11 has:

 $ wireplumber --version
 wireplumber
 Compiled with libwireplumber 0.4.17
 Linked with libwireplumber 0.4.17
 $ ls -l `which wpctl`
 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 72  1. 1.  1970 /run/current-system/sw/bin/wpctl -> /nix/store/a13fw6xw8fmpf39blrp86w6r7nkfrim5-wireplumber-0.4.17/bin/wpctl

                        (Although I don't yet understand why I still get:)

 $ nix derivation show 'nixpkgs#wireplumber'
 {
   "/nix/store/cawvgg6wk42xmhpg2dm0ax9hxbxfdsfm-wireplumber-0.5.2.drv": {
