   From NixOS Wiki

   The instructions are incomplete and lead to a systm that never runs
   because is missing the local part. This is what worked for me.

   services.postgresql = {
     settings = {
       listen_addresses = "*"; 
     };
     enable = true;
     enableTCPIP = true;
     authentication = pkgs.lib.mkOverride 10 ''
 local all       all     trust
 host all all      ::1/128      trust
 host all postgres 127.0.0.1/32 trust
     '';
   };

   if you just do the part that accepts TCP connections WITHOUT the local, it
   just doesn't run because it is missing it.
