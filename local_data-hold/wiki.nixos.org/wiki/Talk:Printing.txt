   Proposed replacement for hp-setup example command

   On NixOS 22.05 I can't use

 $ nix run nixpkgs.hplipWithPlugin -c sudo hp-setup

   because the nix run command has a different syntax that doesn't recognize
   the -c flag. What ended up working for me (on XFCE but not on Sway, but
   that's another matter) is:

 $ NIXPKGS_ALLOW_UNFREE=1 nix --extra-experimental-features nix-command --extra-experimental-features --flakes shell --impure nixpkgs#hplipWithPlugin --command sudo hp-setup

   I arrived at this through experimentation and I don't know if it fully
   fits best practices, so I'm proposing it on the Talk page instead of just
   adding it to the article.
