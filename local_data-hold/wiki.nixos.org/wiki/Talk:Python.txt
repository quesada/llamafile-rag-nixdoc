   Python version?

Conda

   conda-env does not exist after entering the conda-shell without first
   calling conda-install, so I think the wiki is missleading here, or the
   package has a bug. conda-shell, conda-install have no effect and nothing
   happens. Bash just says it can't find that command.

shellHook explanation

   It's not clear what the meaning of all the `shellHook` stuff is for, esp.
   the unset SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH bit.

How to use specific Python version?

   Latest comment: 19 September 20211 comment1 person in discussion

   I'm working on a project where we're using a specific patch version of
   Python. How would I set this up? This uses a Python fork, but I'm looking
   for a specific version of the official Python package.

Flake example for use with nix develop

   I was trying to get python with packages as defined by a flake, and found
   https://dev.to/deciduously/workspace-management-with-nix-flakes-jupyter-notebook-example-2kke
   a useful discussion. I propose to add an example:

 {
   description = "Python environment";
   inputs.nixpkgs.url = "nixpkgs/nixos-22.11";
   outputs = {nixpkgs, ...}: let
     system = "x86_64-linux";
     pkgs = import nixpkgs {inherit system;};
   in {
     devShells.${system}.default = pkgs.mkShell {
       buildInputs = [
         (pkgs.python3.withPackages (p: [
           p.requests
         ]))
       ];
       shellHook = "python";
     };
   };
 }
