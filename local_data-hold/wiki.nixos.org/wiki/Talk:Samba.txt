   The "mount as user" section on this page suggests the following to pull
   the uid and gid from the configuration:

 ["${automount_opts},credentials=/etc/nixos/smb-secrets,${config.users.users.<username>.uid},gid=${config.users.groups.<group>.gid}"];

   Two issues with this:

    1. It's missing "uid="
    2. The uid and gid attributes are integers, and nix refuses to coerce
       them to strings

   It should probably read something like this (which is working for me):

 ["${automount_opts},credentials=/etc/nixos/smb-secrets,uid=${toString config.users.users.<username>.uid},gid=${toString config.users.groups.<group>.gid}"];

   I'm very new to NixOS though so I don't want to update the page in case
   I've missed something.
