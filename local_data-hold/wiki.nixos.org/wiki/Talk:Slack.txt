   Hello,

   It seems that using

   xdg = {

  portal = {
    enable = true;
    extraPortals = with pkgs; [
      xdg-desktop-portal-wlr
      xdg-desktop-portal-gtk
    ];
    gtkUsePortal = true;
  };

   };

   results in some conflict errors. I am using wayland and

   xdg = {

  portal = {
    enable = true;
    extraPortals = with pkgs; [
      xdg-desktop-portal-wlr
    ];
    gtkUsePortal = true;
  };

   };

   seems to work. should we update the docs?

    Deprecated options

   Other question, it seems that xdg.portal.gtkUsePortal is deprecated right
   now, what would be a valid fix for this?
