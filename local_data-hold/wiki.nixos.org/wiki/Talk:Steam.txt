   lacks a section

"Steam fails to start. What do I do?" Paragraph needs improvements.

   This paragraph is lacking useful information. For instance, where can one
   obtain the package strace? As for bug reporting, where might one create a
   bug report?

The comment under me lacks a section

   Elaborating on the incomplete flag (expansion template): Tried to install
   steam the way it is described here, and even with nix-shell, but no joy.
   Read a lot about steam-run but have no clue what it is, or how to use it,
   and the package description is completely devoid of any info. --Toraritte

   Finally I can run GOG on NixOS without patching or repatching any
   executable. Figured it out, hope it helps others. Big kudo's to
   maintainers of steam and steam-run for the wonderful expression!! Cx405

if you get "error: lib not defined"

   The config code that includes lib.getName will error if simply included in
   configuration.nix unless "lib" is included in the list of args at the top;
   example: `{ config, pkgs, lib, ... }:`

Failed to create SDL window

   You may have `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland` set in your environment, which
   seems to bother some older titles (e.g. original Half-Life). Set the
   launch options in the steam UI to 'SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11 %command%' and it
   should work.
