How to avoid running out of space while building?

   tl;dr Would it be possible to mention which of the options are applicable
   during a nix-build?

   I'm running into issues with running out of space while trying to
   nix-build on a GitLab.com runner:

 $ nix-build '<nixpkgs/nixos>' -I nixos-config=configuration.nix --option min-free $((100 * 1000 * 1000)) --option max-free $((1000 * 1000 * 1000))

   It looks like the min-free and max-free options are working, but it's
   running out of space while garbage collecting? Also, I can't quite tell
   which one of these options are relevant to a nix-build run, so it would be
   a bit of programming by accident if I started trying everything out to see
   if any of it will make the build work.
