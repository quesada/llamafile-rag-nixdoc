Calls to dbus-update-activation-environment

   Note that the default sway configuration template /etc/sway/config
   includes /etc/sway/config.d/*, and specifically includes
   /etc/sway/config.d/nixos.conf, which has the following contents:

    # Import the most important environment variables into the D-Bus and systemd
    # user environments (e.g. required for screen sharing and Pinentry prompts):
    exec dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd DISPLAY WAYLAND_DISPLAY SWAYSOCK XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP

   Likewise, the example configuration in the wiki creates a script
   /bin/dbus-sway-environment that attempts to call
   dbus-update-activation-environment. (In spite of the partial redundancy
   with /etc/sway/config.d/nixos.conf, the dbus-sway-environment script still
   seems to be necessary to get the required user dbus services successfully
   started.) However, neither of these attempts to execute

    dbus-update-activation-environment

   works unless dbus-update-activation-environment is in the path (e.g.,
   unless there is a symlink
   /run/current-system/sw/bin/dbus-update-activation-environment pointing at
   the executable somewhere under /nix/store/). To get
   dbus-update-activation-environment and the other binaries from the dbus
   package into the general path, one should add pkgs.dbus to the
   environment.systemPackages list in configuration.nix. (If using home
   manager, this might be accomplished by other means.)

   Scenario:

   On real hardware, I installed nixos with calamares but no desktop
   environment selected. Then, I proceeded with flakes and home manager
   proper configuration. Then I tried to follow the sway guide for home
   manager. It was then that I ran into this issue
   <https://discourse.nixos.org/t/wlr-errors-when-trying-to-start-sway/28698>.
   The solution of that thread worked for me.

   So, I propose that <hardware.opengl.enable = true> to be added in the sway
   with home manager session,

   To set up Sway using Home Manager, first you must enable Polkit in your
   nix configuration:

   security.polkit.enable = true;

   Additionally, you must enable opengl in your nix configuration //<<<<NEW
   LINE 1>>>>

   hardware.opengl.enable = true; //<<<<NEW LINE 2>>>>

   A general suggestion of 2 new lines can be seen above.

   I just registered and I am new to nixos. I don't know the rules about
   editing the page, so I decided to post it as discussion first.

           Hello RafTeog,
           you can just start to edit the main page here. Its sometimes
           difficult to see whether a fix is just needed because you have
           some special circumstances. I am not a Sway user - maybe there are
           some circumstances where you dont need OpenGL, because you have an
           xserver enabled?
           It may be a good way to just add a „Troubleshooting“ chapter and
           add your information about opengl and a link to the
           discource-discussion as a subsection. And: The troubleshooting
           chapter is already in this article. Maybe a subchapter like
           „Errors when trying to start sway?“.
           Just start to contribute - have fun while doing it. Lets make this
           wiki ready for the 24.5 release together. Klinger (talk) 21:04, 2

                        Greetings,
                        I will do that, and follow all the advices provided.
                        Thank you very much, glad to be here! RafTeog (talk)
