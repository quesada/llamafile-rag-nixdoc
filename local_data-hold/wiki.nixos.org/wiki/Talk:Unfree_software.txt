   From NixOS Wiki

   Usage of nixpkgs.config all over the page seems misleading in light of
   nixpkgs PR 257458 - fail when nixpkgs.config is set with explicit pkgs,
   remove all nixpkgs.config usages in in-tree modules.

   There is no native support for defining unfree software in multiple places
   - nixpkgs issues 197325. There is a solution in the comments of this
   issue. It might be worth including in the page until native support is
   provided.
