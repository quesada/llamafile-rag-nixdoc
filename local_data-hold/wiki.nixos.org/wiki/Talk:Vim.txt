Plugin Names

   It'd be great to make it easier for users to find the name of the plugin
   they want. When I just now tried doing this, I initially thought I could
   use the "names" listed in vim-plugin-names, so I tried this:

    vimrcConfig.vam.pluginDictionaries = [
        { names = [
            # Here you can place all your vim plugins
            # They are installed managed by `vam` (a vim plugin manager)
            "github:sbdchd/neoformat"
        ]; }
    ];

   But that didn't work, because vam didn't accept "github:sbdchd/neoformat"
   as a name. It took some trial and error to find that I instead needed to
   use "neoformat", which is the name as specified in default.nix.

   Should this page tell users to just check default.nix, or maybe they
   should search nix packages or use "nix-env -qaP .*neoformat.*" and use
   whatever is after "nixos.vimPlugins."?

   True, there is currently no way to say whether neovim is nowayays used
   more than vim, while maybe a poll in r/vim reveals more usage of neovim,
   this is not enough to write it here. I added the „category:Text Editor“
   page to achieve what I originally wanted: Readers should see the
   possibilities and decide what is right for them. Adoption of new text
   editors is slow, according to Arch package statistics vim more often
   installed than vi starting from the year 2023... Klinger (talk) 15:18, 8

           According to the stackoverflow survey in 2023, vim is still more
           popular:
           https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-popular-technologies-integrated-development-environment
           I would expect Nix users to be a bit different in adoption because
           they were also early adopter in other areas like Wayland/Pipewire
           vs X11/Pulseaudio. Mic92 (talk) 08:18, 9 July 2024 (UTC)Reply
