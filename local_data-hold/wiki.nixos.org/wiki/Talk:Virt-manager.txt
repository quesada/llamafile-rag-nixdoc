   {

  users.users.<myuser>.extraGroups = [ "libvirtd" ];

   }

   isn't the group libvirt not libvirtd?

   You have to run under XWayland with `$ GDK_BACKEND=x11 virt-manager` or
   set a gdk cursor like so with home-manager,

  home.pointerCursor = {
     gtk.enable = true;
     package = pkgs.vanilla-dmz;
     name = "Vanilla-DMZ";
  };

   Otherwise you will get an error like the following:

   Error launching details: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'conn'  Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/   nix/store/kg0k9xb64dziq1zbbjiyxd81nbqs9j7p-virt-manager-4.1.0/share/virt-manager/virtManager/vmwindow.py", line 36, in get_instance     key = "%s+%s" % (vm.conn.get_uri(), vm.get_uuid())                      ^^^^^^^ AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'conn' Nebu (talk) 10:34, 20 April 2024 (UTC)Reply
