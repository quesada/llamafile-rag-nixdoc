Issues installing vscode

   Latest comment: 21 January 20191 comment1 person in discussion

   This example is not working anymore with NixOS 18.03 -- not signed

   This example is not working with NixOS 18.09 -- not signed

 $ nix-env -iA nixos.vscode

 $ code
 code: command not found

 #I tried to find it with
 $ nix-env -qaP --description | grep -i vscode

 but got nothing back.

           vscode is the right attribute name. Visual Studio Code is unfree,
           which is why it doesn't seem to work. --samueldr (talk) 18:25, 21
