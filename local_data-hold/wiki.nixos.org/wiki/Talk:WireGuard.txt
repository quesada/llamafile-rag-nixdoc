sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 needed for server

   Latest comment: 8 December 20236 comments4 people in discussion

   done!

   I could only make this work after running

 sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

   .

   This is also mentioned in the Arch wiki.

   I think it should be added here as well. Opinions? --Asymmetric (talk)

   This definitly needs to be in the article, just add a disclaimer that the
   option is only needed for "supernodes" which route traffic, clients
   normally do not need it set --Makefu (talk) 07:43, 18 May 2019 (UTC)Reply

   I feel like the disclaimer is not necessary, since the article refers to a
   client/server mode of operation. --Asymmetric (talk) 14:32, 18 May 2019

   Turns out the flag is already set by the nat module --Asymmetric (talk)

   It would be really cool to have examples for nftables as well, preferably
   with conf files... --Devvythelopper (talk) 14:32, 18 May 2019 (UTC)Reply

  Regarding my addition:

   --Nrbray (talk) 10:35, 8 December 2023 (UTC)Reply

  networking.useNetworkd = true;

   avoids error:

  trace: warning: The combination of `systemd.network.enable = true` [wireguard], `networking.useDHCP = true` and `networking.useNetworkd = false` can cause both networkd and dhcpcd to manage the same interfaces. This can lead to loss of networking. It is recommended you choose only one of networkd (by also enabling `networking.useNetworkd`) or scripting (by disabling `systemd.network.enable`)
