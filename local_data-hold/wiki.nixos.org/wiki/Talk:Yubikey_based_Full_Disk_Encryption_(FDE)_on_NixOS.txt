   I've also added a nix expression to set up a shell:

   If it's useful I can add it here

Can I update/improve this page

   Hi! I'm fairly new to nix/NixOS and tried this guide to rebuild my Yubikey
   based decryption which I previously used in Arch. While following the
   guide, I found some issues and also see some improvements:

     * while the SLOT is definded as env variable, the "2" is hardcoded in
       the yubikey commands
     * the /dev/partition paths didn't work on my VM using NixOS 23.05, I'd
       use the "old" paths /dev/mapper/<name> instead
     * I would add a section that tries to close and reopen the luks device
       with the new credentials to test if the setup was successful
     * I would add a section which adds a password as a Backup decryption
       method (addresses
       https://github.com/sgillespie/nixos-yubikey-luks/issues/7)

   Can I simply edit the page with those changes or is there some PR/review
   process for the wiki pages?
