Open Issues with ZFS enryption

   Should this guide not have a big fat red warning that tells users, that
   openzfs currently has encryption related bugs, which can lead to data loss
   when using recv/send?

   see:

   https://github.com/openzfs/openzfs-docs/issues/494

Add boot.initrd.supportedFilesystems = ["zfs"]; ?

   Latest comment: 22 March 20211 comment1 person in discussion

   What about recommending to also add

 boot.initrd.supportedFilesystems = ["zfs"];

   See https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/99386#issuecomment-798813567

   I think recommending to add this would allow you in the far future to use
   zfs as filesystem without forcing to add grub support for zfs if you don't
   need it.

   I currently have https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/117071 open to
   revert back to that behaviour like it's been in 20.09 (adding a zfs
   filesystem also adds support to grub, more exactly the original behaviour
   was to always enable zfs support in grub even without any zfs filesystem)

Multiple Encrypted Pools Issue

   I tried following the "Import and unlock multiple encrypted pools/dataset
   at boot" section (and friends) but could not get it to work, with the
   dataset either not being mounted, or the boot aborting with a permission
   error. What finally fixed it for me:

  # Create pool like so:
  zpool create <your-other-options> -O keyformat=passphrase pool_name $DISK_HDD
 

   And use this for initrd.network.postCommands:

        cat <<EOF > /root/.profile
        if pgrep -x "zfs" > /dev/null
        then
          zpool import hdd  # Import pool like in example
          sleep 3           #  <---- THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART
          zfs load-key -a
          killall zfs
        else
          echo "zfs not running -- maybe the pool is taking some time to load for some unforseen reason."
        fi
        EOF

   Long story short, I think the example on the ZFS page should include the
   sleep.

Unable to follow instructions from "Laying out the filesystem hierarchy"

   Latest comment: 26 February 20221 comment1 person in discussion

   I tried following the instructions from
   ZFS#Laying_out_the_filesystem_hierarchy but the system never fully booted
   and had errors about being unable to mount "/home" or "/root".

   The fix was to use a legacy mountpoint instead, while also reducing the
   number of ZFS data sets to a minimum and using "/" as a ZFS data set
   instead of tmpfs. --Grische (talk) 12:45, 26 February 2022 (UTC)Reply

Inclusion of /var/persist

   Latest comment: 29 March 20221 comment1 person in discussion

   Looking over the post, there is no mention of creating a /var/persist
   directory. I'd personally recommend adding it as a separate volume/dataset
   which is autosnapshotted in case it is needed.

 # zfs create -o canmount=on rpool/nixos/var/persist
