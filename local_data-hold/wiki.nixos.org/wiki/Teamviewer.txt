   From NixOS Wiki

   Teamviewer is a proprietary software application for remote control,
   desktop sharing, online meetings, web conferencing and file transfer
   between computers.

  Installation

   To perform full installation with a service, add this to your
   configuration.nix:

   services.teamviewer.enable = true;

   Please be aware, that installing Teamviewer by adding it to the
   environment.systemPackages of your configuration.nix:

   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
   ...
   teamviewer
   ...
   ];

   or installing it via nix-env -i teamviewer will not install its
   corresponding service. This will allow Teamviewer to start outgoing
   connections, but will not allow it to receive connections from the
   Internet. Upon the start, Teamviewer will hence display Not ready. Please
   check your connection message.
