   This template provides generic installation instructions for NixOS on ARM
   sub-pages. Look at the other installation instruction templates, there may
   be one more appropriate for the lineage of your board!

 {{ARM/installation allwinner|variant=EXAMPLE|u-boot=EXAMPLE-u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin}}

Preview

   To use the generic installation image for your board, you will need to
   copy it verbatim to an SD card.

 sudo dd if=sd-image-EXAMPLE-linux.img of=/dev/DEVICE conv=sync status=progress

   This board requires the installation of u-boot at a specific location on
   the storage where NixOS was written to.

 sudo dd if=EXAMPLE-u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/dev/DEVICE bs=1024 seek=8
