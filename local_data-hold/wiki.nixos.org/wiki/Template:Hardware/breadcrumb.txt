   From NixOS Wiki

   This template adds a breadcrumb link to the main NixOS on ARM article to
   sub-pages. This has to be added to the top.

   Right now not much is done, but when / if it is possible to do fancier or
   automated things, it will be done here.

   In the future, it is expected to have Manufacturers hubs or something like
   that, when the wiki and nixos gets many more users.
