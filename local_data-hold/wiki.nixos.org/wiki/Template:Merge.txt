   From NixOS Wiki
   This page is a template. It should be used as part of other articles. For
   more information, see Help:Template.

   Please do not experiment with this template; you could ruin all pages
   using this template. If you want to edit this template, copy the text to
   Template:Sandbox, edit and test it there, and copy it back when it works.

   Feel free to discuss this template in the talk page.

   If you wanted to create a new page instead, use the search box to search
   for the title of the new page you want to create and follow the link
   Create the page "XYZ" on this wiki! in the results page. An alternative is
   to create a dangling link to the new page from an existing page. A final
   option is to directly visit the expected URL of the page.

About

   A merge flag used to suggest merging of two articles.

Usage

 {{Merge|Article to merge with|reason}}

   You can override the default discussion page with a third optional
   argument

 {{Merge|Article to merge with|reason|Talk:Article to be merged#Merge discussion}}

   Alternatively you can point to a specific section in the default talk page
   with the named section parameter:

 {{Merge|Article to merge with|reason|section=Section name}}

   Flagged pages can be found in Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Merge or in
   Category:Pages or sections flagged with Template:Merge. Users are
   encouraged to participate in merger discussions or simply complete the
   merge (if sensible). The {{Merge}} flag should be removed after the merge
   is completed or the proposal is rejected.

   Note: The talk page is linked through an external link: this is to avoid
   polluting Special:WantedPages when the talk page does not exist.

Example

 {{Merge|Template:Merge|This is just a demonstration template.}}

    This article or section is a candidate for merging with Template:Merge.   
    Notes: This is just a demonstration template. (Discuss in Template        
    talk:Merge#)
