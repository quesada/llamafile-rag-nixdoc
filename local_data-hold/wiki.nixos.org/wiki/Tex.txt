   From NixOS Wiki

   According to Wikipedia:

           TeX [...]is a typesetting system which was designed and mostly
           written by Donald Knuth and released in 1978. TeX is a popular
           means of typesetting complex mathematical formulae; it has been
           noted as one of the most sophisticated digital typographical
           systems.

   Nixpkgs provides a variety of different (and partially complementing)
   packages to allow the compilation of TeX-documents. Most prominently, the
   TexLive distribution (In Oct 2020 version 2019) is included that contains
   many of the packages that are hosted as part of the Comprehensive TeX
   Archive Network (CTAN).

Getting started

   TeX-documents are not What-you-see-is-what-you-get, but written in plain
   text, containing tags, commands and functions that instruct the TeX-engine
   how to lay out the text (or figures or anything else) on the page.

   A minimal TeX-document can be created on the commandline using this
   shell-snippet:

 cat > minimal.tex <<'EOF'
 \documentclass{article}
 \begin{document}
 Hello, Nix.
 \end{document}
 EOF

   The Nixpkgs-repository contains several TeX-compilers that have different
   advantages and disadvantages, support various output formats, encodings
   and have varying degrees of extensibility.

   For the sake of this text we will assume that you you want to create a PDF
   from your TeX-source.

   A good starting point is to install the TeX-Live basic setup:

   nix-env -iA nixpkgs.texlive.combined.scheme-basic

   After installation, the command pdflatex should be available. Save the
   minimal example above in a file called minimal.tex and compile it with
   pdflatex minimal.tex

   The (pretty verbose) output will look similar to:

 $ pdflatex minimal.tex
 This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.21 (TeX Live 2019/NixOS.org)
 entering extended mode
 (minimal.tex

 Output written on minimal.pdf (1 page, 12502 bytes).

   Well done, you created your first PDF document on Nixos using TeX.

Next steps

   From here on, we will assume that the "Full" scheme is installed.

   Let's fetch an a little more complex example:

   curl -O
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/latex3/latex2e/master/base/sample2e.tex

   and process it

   pdflatex sample2e

   You can then use any PDF viewer to display it, e.g. evince in GNOME,
   okular in KDE, xpdf or zathura lightweight X11-viewer.

  Using Texlive packages

   If you need many different packages or find that you are missing packages,
   consider to install the package nixpkgs.texlive.combined.scheme-full, but
   be aware that it is pretty huge (about 5 GB).

   If you don't want to install the Full scheme, but still need a collection
   of specific packages, follow the instructions on the TexLive page.

  Using CTAN packages

   If you want to use a CTAN-package that is not in TeXLive, you will have to
   adapt any of the derivations that you can find in these issues, e.g. [1]
   (eqexam) or or [2] (classico) or [3] (res). Please note that the most
   common reason why packages are not in TeXLive is that they might be
   released under a non-free license.

  Using home-made packages

  Removing packages from a collection

   If you want to package and install a fresher version of some TeXLive
   package, you might experience a collision with a package from a scheme or
   a collection you have installed as a whole. To resolve this issue, remove
   the package by pname from pkgs.

   Example code:

     pkgs.texlive.combine {
       scheme-medium = pkgs.texlive.scheme-medium // {
         pkgs = pkgs.lib.filter
           (x: (x.pname != "apxproof"))
           pkgs.texlive.scheme-medium.pkgs;
       };
    
       apxproof = { pkgs = [(pkgs.runCommand "apxproof" {
         src = pkgs.fetchurl {
           url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreSenellart/apxproof/1ac14c47b8351b693ca05eec73dca1332a517ac9/apxproof.sty";
           sha256 = "sha256-XSgtXsOwhMu2Wo4hVp8ZfaPWgjEEg3EBn5/BhD3xkMA=";
         };
         passthru = {
           pname = "apxproof";
           version = "1.2.3";
           tlType = "run";
         };
       }
       "
         mkdir -p $out/tex/latex/apxproof/
         cp $src $out/tex/latex/apxproof/apxproof.sty
       ")]; };
     }

Frequently asked questions FAQ

   How do I figure out which Texlive-schema to install?

   As noted on TexLive there are several schemas available. If you know
   exactly which packages you are going to need you can follow the recipe on
   the TexLive page. Installing the Full-schema is always an option to be
   sure that you have everything you need, like so:

   nix-env -iA nixpkgs.texlive.combined.scheme-full

   If you are looking for a smaller package, you need to go the Nixpkg's
   package specification and search for the scheme-name. For each scheme the
   list of packages is listed there. Since the inclusion of packages is
   organized hierarchically, this will require some digging. (TODO: Is there
   a nix-command to find out?)
