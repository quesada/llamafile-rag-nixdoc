   From NixOS Wiki

   According to Wikipedia:

           TeX Live is a free software distribution for the TeX typesetting
           system that includes major TeX-related programs, macro packages,
           and fonts.

Installation

   Since TeX Live consist of thousands of packages, to make managing it
   easier, NixOS replicates the organization of TeX Live into 'schemes' and
   'collections'

   The following Tex Live schemes are available:

   Name of TeX    Name of Nixos-derivation                Comment             
   Live package   
   Scheme-full    nixpkgs.texlive.combined.scheme-full    Contains every TeX  
                                                          Live package        
                                                          contains everything 
   Scheme-medium  nixpkgs.texlive.combined.scheme-medium  in the small scheme 
                                                          + more packages and 
                                                          languages           
                                                          contains everything 
   Scheme-small   nixpkgs.texlive.combined.scheme-small   in the basic scheme 
                                                          + xetex, metapost,  
                                                          a few languages.    
                                                          contains everything 
   Scheme-basic   nixpkgs.texlive.combined.scheme-basic   in the plain scheme 
                                                          but includes latex. 
   Scheme-minimal nixpkgs.texlive.combined.scheme-minimal contains plain      
                                                          only.               
                                                          contains more than  
   Scheme-teTeX   nixpkgs.texlive.combined.scheme-tetex   the medium scheme,  
                                                          but nowhere near    
                                                          the full scheme.    
   Scheme-ConTeXt nixpkgs.texlive.combined.scheme-context contains ConTeXt    
   Scheme-GUST    nixpkgs.texlive.combined.scheme-gust    contains gust       

  Combine Sets

   You can install a set with extra packages by using something like

   (texlive.combine { inherit (texlive) scheme-medium xifthen ifmtarg framed
   paralist titlesec; })

   For a minimal set of packages needed for Emacs Orgmode, as described in
   org-latex-default-packages-alist variable, install these packages:

 { config, pkgs, ... }:
 let
   tex = (pkgs.texlive.combine {
     inherit (pkgs.texlive) scheme-basic
       dvisvgm dvipng # for preview and export as html
       wrapfig amsmath ulem hyperref capt-of;
       #(setq org-latex-compiler "lualatex")
       #(setq org-preview-latex-default-process 'dvisvgm)
   });
 in
 { # home-manager
   home.packages = with pkgs; [
     tex
   ];
 }

Adding a Custom Package

   If you have a custom LaTeX package or style file that is not part of the
   TeXLive distribution, you can add it to the package set like this:

   First, create a derivation for your package. The contents of $out/tex will
   later be placed in texmf/tex

 latex-corporate-identity = pkgs.stdenvNoCC.mkDerivation {
   name = "latex-corporate-identity";
   src = ./path/to/package/tree;
   installPhase = "cp -r $src $out";
   passthru.tlType = "run";
 };


 texlive-corporate-identity = {
   pkgs = [ latex-corporate-identity ];
 };

   The directory tree under the path specified as src looks like this:

 └── tex
     └── latex
         └── corporate-identity
             ├── corporate-identity.sty

   You can now add the package to the combined set as you would with any
   other texlive package:

 tex = pkgs.texlive.combine {
   inherit (pkgs.texlive) scheme-full;
   inherit texlive-corporate-identity;
 };

Troubleshooting

  Missing lmodern.sty

   If LaTex (perhaps through Pandoc) complains about missing lmodern.sty,
   make sure you have at least texlive.combined.scheme-medium installed
   (-full should work as well; while -small worked for some, but not for
   all).

  Invalid fontname ‘Latin Modern Roman/ICU’

   If you get an error message saying “Invalid fontname ‘Latin Modern
   Roman/ICU’. . . ”, then you need to add the entry lmodern into your
   configuration in the section fonts.fonts and rebuild.
