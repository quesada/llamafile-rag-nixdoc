   Thunar is a GTK file manager originally made for Xfce.

Installation

   Thunar will automatically be installed by enabling Xfce.

   If you want to install Thunar standalone, add to your configuration.nix:

 programs.thunar.enable = true;

Configuration

   If xfce is not used as desktop and therefore xfconf is not enabled,
   preference changes are discarded. In that case enable the xfconf program
   manually to be able to save preferences:

 programs.xfconf.enable = true;

  Plugins

   You can add plugins by including them in programs.thunar.plugins to your
   configuration.nix. For example:

 programs.thunar.plugins = with pkgs.xfce; [
   thunar-archive-plugin
   thunar-volman
 ];

  Other functionalities

   You can extend Thunar's functionalities by adding to your
   configuration.nix:

 services.gvfs.enable = true; # Mount, trash, and other functionalities
 services.tumbler.enable = true; # Thumbnail support for images

    Tip                                                                       
    You must logout and login again, after enabling gvfs, for the plugin to   
    be active in Thunar                                                       

   You can extend Tumbler's support to other file formats by adding more
   packages to environment.systemPackages. See here for a list (the names may
   not match 1:1).
