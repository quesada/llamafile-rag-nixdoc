   From NixOS Wiki

   Thunderbird is an open-source e-mail client for desktop environments,
   which also functions as a full personal information manager with a
   calendar and address book, as well as an RSS feed reader, chat client
   (IRC/XMPP/Matrix), and news client.

Install Thunderbird

   In NixOS 24.11 onwards, set programs.thunderbird.enable = true.

   In NixOS 24.05 or older, add pkgs.thunderbird to
   environment.systemPackages.

Configuration of Thunderbird

   Thunderbird stores configuration and data in the hidden .thunderbird
   folder in the home directories. There are the following solutions:

     * Use Nixpkgs, currently setting policies and preferences is supported
       (Usable in unstable, will be available in version 24.11).
     * Use Home Manager.
     * Manual configuration with the Thunderbird GUI and backup (and move to
       others PCs) of the .thunderbird folder. Using IMAP with server-side
       storage will enable to have several instances of Thunderbird with the
       same settings and e-mail content.
