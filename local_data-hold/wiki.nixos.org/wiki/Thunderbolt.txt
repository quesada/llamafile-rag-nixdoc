Plasma

   To benefit from Plasma's UI for managing Thunderbolt devices, you may
   install the System Settings panel. Just add this to your packages:
   plasma5Packages.plasma-thunderbolt.

Enable the Bolt daemon

   Even if you don't use Gnome, you may want to enable the Bolt daemon - just
   configure the following:

 services.hardware.bolt.enable = true;

   This will enable the bolt daemon on your system.

   For the description of this option, cf.
   https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=21.11&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=services.hardware.bolt.enable.

Enroll Thunderbolt devices

   If your Thunderbolt device does not work, execute boltctl in a terminal.
   This will show you your connected devices, and their respective uuid. In
   color terminals, it will show you if your device is authorized (green
   light) or not (orange light).

   For each device that is not authorized, execute boltctl enroll --chain
   UUID_FROM_YOUR_DEVICE.

   Note: You'll have to replace UUID_FROM_YOUR_DEVICE with your device's
   actual uuid

   .

   Check with boltctl whether all your devices have been enrolled (green
   light everywhere).

Dell's TB16 dock

   On a Dell XPS 13" 9360, the TB16 is not always authorised automatically,
   and you may have the impression that it does not work correctly (connected
   USB devices won't work while the DisplayPort may work...).

   When connecting a TB16, boltctl shows 2 devices: Dell Thunderbolt Dock and
   Dell Thunderbolt Cable.

   It is enough to enroll the Dell Thunderbolt Dock with the --chain
   parameter, as this will also automatically enroll the Dell Thunderbolt
   Cable.

USB ports not working

   If the USB ports are not working, you can try running `echo 1 >
   /sys/bus/pci/rescan`. If this causes the error `No bus number available
   for hot-added bridge` to appear in `journalctl`, adding
   `pci=assign-busses,hpbussize=0x33,realloc,hpmemsize=128M,hpmemprefsize=1G`
   may fix your issue. (Thanks to
