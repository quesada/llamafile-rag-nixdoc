   From NixOS Wiki

   tmux is a "terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals (or
   windows), each running a separate program, to be created, accessed, and
   controlled from a single screen. tmux may be detached from a screen and
   continue running in the background, then later reattached."

Global configuration

   tmux can be configured globally from /etc/nixos/configuration.nix.

   As an example:

 programs.tmux = {
   enable = true;
   clock24 = true;
   extraConfig = '' # used for less common options, intelligently combines if defined in multiple places.
     ...
   '';
 }

   Note that extraConfig writes directly to /etc/tmux.conf

   There is a good example of tmux configuration here.

  Using Plugins

   Tmux plugins can be also configured using programs.tmux.plugins. They can
   be found as NixOS packages: tmuxPlugins. Each of the tmux plugin is run
   via run-shell automatically. Some plugins need to be run after having had
   some custom configuration done>, but extraConfig gets executed after. For
   example tmuxPlugins.cpu needs the status line be declared before the
   plugin is run. For that scenario, run-shell can be added within
   extraConfig:

 programs.tmux = {
   enable = true;
   extraConfig = ''
     ...
     set -g status-right '#[fg=black,bg=color15] #{cpu_percentage}  %H:%M '
     run-shell ${pkgs.tmuxPlugins.cpu}/share/tmux-plugins/cpu/cpu.tmux
   '';
 }

Per-user configuration

   However, if you want to configure per user, you could use Home Manager.
   This also grants you with more options available directly through nix, as
   opposed to through an extra config option. Though it should be noted that
   a few of the options have different names.
