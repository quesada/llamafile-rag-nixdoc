    This article or section needs expansion.                                  
    Reason: This article is a stub. (Discuss in Talk:Transmission#)           
    Please consult the pedia article metapage for guidelines on contributing. 

Installation

   Install by adding transmission_4-qt or transmission_4-gtk to your packages
   list

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ transmission_4-qt ];

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ transmission_4-gtk ];

   If you want to configure the settings declaratively with within
   configuration.nix, you will have to instead install transmission-qt or
   transmission-gtk. Do note that this is using version 3.0.0 instead of
   version 4.

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ transmission-qt ];

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ transmission-gtk ];

Service configuration

   You can declaratively change the settings via Nix by modifying
   services.transmission.settings. View the documentation for more info. Like
   the previous section has said before, you'll have to use the nixpkgs
   transmission-gtk or transmission-qt for this to work.

   Example:

 services.transmission.settings = {
   download-dir = "${config.services.transmission.home}/Downloads";
 };

  Password-protected RPC

   The default method of editing the configuration and restarting the daemon
   will not work because of the way the configuration is handled. It is
   however possible to once set it in clear in the settings, and then copy
   the generated hash to the setting, removing the in-clear copy from the
   configuration.

  Example: allow remote access

   To control the daemon remotely, put the following lines in your
   /etc/nixos/configuration.nix:

 services.transmission = {
     enable = true; #Enable transmission daemon
     openRPCPort = true; #Open firewall for RPC
     settings = { #Override default settings
       rpc-bind-address = "0.0.0.0"; #Bind to own IP
       rpc-whitelist = "127.0.0.1,10.0.0.1"; #Whitelist your remote machine (10.0.0.1 in this example)
     };
   };
