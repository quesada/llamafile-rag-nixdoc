   From NixOS Wiki

   Tiny Tiny RSS is a free and open source web-based news feed (RSS/Atom)
   reader and aggregator.

Install

 services.tt-rss = {
   enable = true;
   # to configure a nginx virtual host directly:
   virtualHost = "tt-rss.example.com";
   selfUrlPath = "https://tt-rss.example.com";
   # or for hosting on sub-path:
   selfUrlPath = "https://example.com/tt-rss";
 };

Configuration

   By default tt-rss creates an admin user with password password. After
   logging in for the first time, do not forget to change it!

  Disabling the admin user completely

   After installing and creating a new user, you can disable the admin by
   setting its access level to -2 [1].

   Either manually by running:

 sudo -u tt_rss nix-shell -p php \
   --run 'php /var/lib/tt-rss/www/update.php --user-set-access-level "admin:-2"'

   You can even automate this to ensure it is always set to -2 by e.g.
   utilising a PreStart snippet:

 systemd.services.tt-rss.preStart = lib.mkAfter ''
   ${pkgs.php}/bin/php ${config.services.tt-rss.root}/www/update.php \
     --user-set-access-level "admin:-2"
 '';

  Enabling TLS for nginx virtual host

   Assuming you have ACME set-up for example.com:

 services.nginx.virtualHosts."${config.services.tt-rss.virtualHost}" = {
   forceSSL = true;
   useACMEHost = "example.com"
 };
