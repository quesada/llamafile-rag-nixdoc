  Projects

     * yarn2nix: converting yarn.lock files to build npm projects with nix
     * Package testing: an infrastructure to test nix derivations (without
       the need of VM tests)
          * I gave a talk about that on the 2017 NixCon
     * Building minimal OCI/docker containers from nixpkgs, see
       Workgroup:Container

  Ideas

    nixpkgs support matrix

   Note: grahamc mentioned (via peti) that SUSE uses a ring-0, ring-1, …
   naming for the different support levels, which we should adopt to not
   introduce any more confusion in nix(pkgs/OS) naming.

                 x86_64  glibc   darwin  armv7   musl    
   Core          full    full    full    full    support 
   Extended Core full    full    support support ask     
   Supported     support support support support ask     
   Maintained    support ask     ask     ask     ask     
   Unmaintained  none    none    none    none    none    

   Support Levels:

     * full: always tested, up-to-date, backported and release blocker
     * support: tested and actively maintained, backported
     * ask: guarantees given depend on the maintainer and package
          * adding/re-purposing meta attributes to indicate guarantees might
            be a good idea
     * none: not maintained (but might still be useful and is therefore not
       deleted)

   Support Tiers:

     * Core: Small (low three-digit) number of packages maintained by active
       core team
     * Extended Core: less vital packages maintained by active maintainers
          * About the same level as Archlinux core packages
          * Stuff like e.g. KDE goes here
     * Supported: actively maintained by wider community, (automatically)
       tested on core systems [, backported]
     * Maintained: maintained, probably only manually tested on the
       maintainer’s system
     * Unmaintained: no maintainer, might not be on the newest version or
       broken because of updated dependencies

   The MAINTAINERS file of the Linux kernel has the following categories:

 S: Status, one of the following:
   Supported:    Someone is actually paid to look after this.
   Maintained:   Someone actually looks after it.
   Odd Fixes:    It has a maintainer but they don't have time to do
   much other than throw the odd patch in. See below..
   Orphan:       No current maintainer [but maybe you could take the
   role as you write your new code].
   Obsolete:     Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally means
   it has been replaced by a better system and you
   should be using that.

   Especially the “there’s somebody paid to maintain this subsystem” label is
   an idea we should incorporate.
