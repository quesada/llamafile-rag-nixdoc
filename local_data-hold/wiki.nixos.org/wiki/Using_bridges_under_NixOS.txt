Using bridges under NixOS

   If you want to use macvtap bridges in KVM, LXC, Xen or $hypervisor on
   NixOS you have to tell your dhcp server to not configure that interface
   with an ip. Yes exactly the dhcp server on NixOS configures every
   interface as long it has been told to not to.

   If you are running dhcpcd then you have to define

 networking.dhcpcd.denyInterfaces = [ "macvtap0@*" ]

   for example.

   What is the error you get when layer 2 bridges have IPs? stackoverflow
   issue
