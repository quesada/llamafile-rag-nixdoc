    This article or section needs expansion.                                  
    Reason: This article is a stub. (Discuss in Talk:Vagrant#)

   boxes.

NixOS as Host

  Using NFS mounts

   Add to your Vagrantfile:

   # Mount a folder inside the VM.
   config.vm.synced_folder "myfolder/", "/mnt/myfolder", type: "nfs", nfs_version: 4

   Add to your configuration.nix:

 {
   # Minimal configuration for NFS support with Vagrant.
   services.nfs.server.enable = true;
  
   # Add firewall exception for VirtualBox provider
   networking.firewall.extraCommands = ''
     ip46tables -I INPUT 1 -i vboxnet+ -p tcp -m tcp --dport 2049 -j ACCEPT
   '';

   # Add firewall exception for libvirt provider when using NFSv4
   networking.firewall.interfaces."virbr1" = {                                  
     allowedTCPPorts = [ 2049 ];                                              
     allowedUDPPorts = [ 2049 ];                                              
   };    
 }

   This should make NFS mounts work.

   Note: Vagrant will, by default, want to use sudo and modify /etc/exports.
   As long as you are not defining exports with configuration.nix, vagrant
   should be able to work.
   Note: Home directories are set not to be world-searchable by default on
   NixOS. This may lead to a "permission denied" error when trying to mount
   directories within your home into the VM. You can change this by running
   chmod a+x ~, but note that this will allow all users on the system to read
   world-readable files within your home given the paths.
   Warning: Since Vagrant 2.3.4 a bug is preventing the mounting of the nfs
   folders. The issue is vagrant try to call System V instead of Systemd in
   order to get the status of nfs service. For details and workaround : [1]

Plugins

  NixOS Plugin

   See the NixOS vagrant box page, which as information about the
   vagrant-nixos-plugin project.

Troubleshooting: conflicting dependencies bundler when installing vagrant
plugins

   As of 18.03 vagrant plugins are broken:

 $  vagrant plugin update
 Updating installed plugins...
 Bundler, the underlying system Vagrant uses to install plugins,
 reported an error. The error is shown below. These errors are usually
 caused by misconfigured plugin installations or transient network
 issues. The error from Bundler is:
 conflicting dependencies bundler (= 1.14.6) and bundler (= 1.16.1)
   Activated bundler-1.16.1
   which does not match conflicting dependency (= 1.14.6)
   Conflicting dependency chains:
     bundler (= 1.16.1), 1.16.1 activated
   versus:
     bundler (= 1.14.6)
   Gems matching bundler (= 1.14.6):
     bundler-1.14.6

   using the following nix expression fixes the problems:

 (import <nixpkgs> {
     overlays = [
       (self: super: {
         bundler = super.bundler.overrideAttrs (old: {
           name = "bundler-1.16.1";
           src = super.fetchurl {
             url = "https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler-1.16.1.gem";
             sha256 = "1s2nq4qnffxg3kwrk7cnwxcvfihlhxm9absl2l6d3qckf3sy1f22";
           };
         });
       })
     ];
   }).vagrant
