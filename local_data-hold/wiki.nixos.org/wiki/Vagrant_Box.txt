   The vagrant cloud has a NixOS box, but it is an older revision and hasn't
   been updated for a short while^[1], it is currently stuck to the much
   older 16.09 release.

   The tooling used to build the boxes is still available and still
   maintained. It is @zimbatm's nixbox project.

Building a recent box

   There are some small caveats with the tooling, one will need to do a bit
   of work to get it working, and then working in a reliable manner on slower
   hardware.

   First, in the nixos-x86_64.json file, remove the post-processor of type
   atlas, unless you want to push the image on the vagrant cloud (you're on
   your own there).

   Then, it may be necessary to increase the boot_wait a bit, on a Haswell
   laptop-class CPU, with SSD, 30 seconds was a few seconds too short,
   doubling is almost sure to be enough for most uses. This is only used once
   during the build of the .box file.

   Then, continue with the instructions in the README.

NixOS Plugin

    This article or section needs expansion.                                  
    Reason: This article is a stub. (Discuss in Talk:Vagrant Box#)            
    Please consult the pedia article metapage for guidelines on contributing. 

   The vagrant-nixos-plugin project adds nix provisioning for NixOS guests in
   vagrant. The project's README should explain its use.
