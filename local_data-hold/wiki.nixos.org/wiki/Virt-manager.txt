   From NixOS Wiki

   The virt-manager application is a GUI for managing local and remote
   virtual machines through libvirt. It primarily targets KVM VMs, but also
   manages Xen and LXC (linux containers).

Requisites

   Even though Virt-manager (using the KVM hypervisor) is able to take
   advantage of virtualisation capabilities without any UEFI/BIOS
   configuration, best performances demand that host have Vt-x and Vt-d
   (Intel) or AMD-V and AMD-Vi (AMD) enabled. These settings can usually be
   found under the UEFI/BIOS settings.

Installation

  NixOS

 virtualisation.libvirtd.enable = true;
 programs.virt-manager.enable = true;

   You may get the following error:

   authentication unavailable: no polkit agent available to authenticate
   action 'org.libvirt.unix.manage'

   To resolve, add the user to the libvirtd group:

 {
   users.users.<myuser>.extraGroups = [ "libvirtd" ];
 }

  Networking

   The default network starts off as being inactive, you must enable it
   before it is accessible. This can be done by running the following
   command:

   virsh net-start default

   Or autostart:

   virsh net-autostart default

   By default this will enable the virbr0 virtual network bridge.

   Sorry - this seems out of date. 2024 July 10

 [das@t14:~/nixos/t14]$ virsh net-autostart default
 error: failed to get network 'default'
 error: Network not found: no network with matching name 'default'

  Display

   The default Video may not allow different resolutions, `Virtio` will allow
   for more.

  Windows Guest

   See Virtio-win guest tools for additional drivers for both paravirtual and
   emulated hardware

  Guest Agent

   When running NixOS as a guest, enable the QEMU guest agent with:

 {
   services.qemuGuest.enable = true;
   services.spice-vdagentd.enable = true;  # enable copy and paste between host and guest
 }

   The host must provide the needed virtio serial port under the special name
   org.qemu.guest_agent.0.

  Wayland

   In order to run on Wayland, virt-manager must be ran under XWayland with
   `$ GDK_BACKEND=x11 virt-manager` or a gdk cursor must be set. An example
   of setting a gdk cursor with home-manager is as follows:

  home.pointerCursor = {
     gtk.enable = true;
     package = pkgs.vanilla-dmz;
     name = "Vanilla-DMZ";
  };
