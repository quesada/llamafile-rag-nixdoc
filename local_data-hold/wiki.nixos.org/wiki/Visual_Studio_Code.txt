Installation

  NixOS

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ vscode ];

   Extensions can be managed using the 'vscode-with-extensions' package:

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
   (vscode-with-extensions.override {
     vscodeExtensions = with vscode-extensions; [
       bbenoist.nix
       ms-python.python
       ms-azuretools.vscode-docker
       ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh
     ] ++ pkgs.vscode-utils.extensionsFromVscodeMarketplace [
       {
         name = "remote-ssh-edit";
         publisher = "ms-vscode-remote";
         version = "0.47.2";
         sha256 = "1hp6gjh4xp2m1xlm1jsdzxw9d8frkiidhph6nvl24d0h8z34w49g";
       }
     ];
   })
 ];

   Some examples here: GitHub search for "extensionFromVscodeMarketplace"

   Note: For fetching the sha256 string you can use the following command.
   Make sure to replace the author, the package name and version!

 nix-prefetch-url https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/gallery/publishers/ms-vscode-remote/vsextensions/remote-ssh-edit/0.47.2/vspackage

   extensionsFromVscodeMarketplace is a manual way to fetch extensions.
   However, to keep updated from upstream,
   nix-community/nix-vscode-extensions provides the Nix expressions for the
   majority of available extensions from Open VSX and VSCode Marketplace. A
   GitHub Action updates the extensions daily.

   It's also possible to install VS Code via Home Manager:

 programs.vscode = {
   enable = true;
   extensions = with pkgs.vscode-extensions; [
     dracula-theme.theme-dracula
     vscodevim.vim
     yzhang.markdown-all-in-one
   ];
 };

     * See for more options: Home Manager Manual: Options - programs.vscode
     * Search for extensions with configurations: NixOS Search:
       vscode-extensions

  Non-NixOS

 $ nix-env -iA nixos.vscode

  Use VS Code extensions without additional configuration

   With the package vscode.fhs, the editor launches inside a FHS compliant
   chroot environment using buildFHSUserEnv. This reintroduces directories
   such as /bin, /lib, and /usr, which allows for extensions which ship
   pre-compiled binaries to work with little to no additional nixification.

   Note: From a philosophical view, use of buildFHSUserEnv allows for
   ease-of-use at the cost of some impurity and non-reproducibility. If you
   prioritize purely-declarative configurations, please stay with the above
   guidance.

   Example usage:

 environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ vscode.fhs ];

   Home-manager:

 programs.vscode = {
   enable = true;
   package = pkgs.vscode.fhs;
 };

   Adding extension-specific dependencies, these will be added to the FHS
   environment:

 # needed for rust lang server and rust-analyzer extension
 programs.vscode.package = pkgs.vscode.fhsWithPackages (ps: with ps; [ rustup zlib openssl.dev pkg-config ]);

  Insiders Build

   If you need to test a recent code change, you can run the insiders build.
   It is designed to run alongside the main build, with a separate
   code-insiders command and a different config path, so you can leave your
   main VS Code instance installed/running.

   The following derivation thanks to @jnoortheen, which you can add to
   home.packages (HM), environment.systemPackages (NixOS), etc., builds a
   package with the latest insiders.

 (pkgs.vscode.override { isInsiders = true; }).overrideAttrs (oldAttrs: rec {
   src = (builtins.fetchTarball {
     url = "https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=insider&os=linux-x64";
     sha256 = "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA";
   });
   version = "latest";

   buildInputs = oldAttrs.buildInputs ++ [ pkgs.krb5 ];
 });

    Updating insiders placeholder sha256:

   You will need to update the placeholder sha256 value for each new Insiders
   build.

   The new value will appear in a validation error when you try to build.

   Put an arbitrary placeholder value in the sha256 field, try to build and
   you'll get an error message regarding the sha256 value.

      If insiders error contains sha256:, follow these instructions:

 //-- ...
        error: hash mismatch in file downloaded from 'https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=insider&os=linux-x64':
          specified: sha256:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
          got:       sha256:16fzxqs6ql4p2apq9aw7l10h4ag1r7jwlfvknk5rd2zmkscwhn6z
 //-- ...

   Take that last line and input it where your placeholder was, 'sha256:' in
   the beginning should be removed.

      If insiders error contains sha256-, follow these instructions:

 //-- ...
         error: hash mismatch in fixed-output derivation '/nix/store/path':
          specified: sha256-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=
             got:    sha256-aQvTtZdPU2F1UjkFxiLs4A+60A4qc9bXKwKriNsCDPg=
 //-- ...

   Take that last line and run the following python script (you can search
   for an online python interpreter if it's not installed), the output will
   give you the correct value:

 import base64
 # The 'sha256-' in the beginning should be removed
 text = b'aQvTtZdPU2F1UjkFxiLs4A+60A4qc9bXKwKriNsCDPg='
 print(base64.decodebytes(text).hex())

   Take the output from this command and input it where your placeholder was.

Creating development environments using nix-shell

   Instead of using configuration.nix to add packages (e.g. Python or NodeJS)
   for developing code on VSCode, you can instead use nix-shell. This will
   allow you to seamlessly create development environments with the correct
   packages for your project, without rebuilding and restarting NixOS. See
   this page for further instructions in building nix-shell development
   environments.

  Automatically switch nix shells when switching projects

   You can do this by using nix-direnv and the VSCode extension direnv for
   integration. View the nix-direnv github page linked for a guide on setting
   it up.

  Alternative for manually switching shells

   The extension nix-env-selector will make switching between different
   nix-shell environments within VSCode so you can switch between different
   coding projects easily and manually. It has a guide for setting up
   nix-shell environments for VSCode.

Wayland

   To use VS Code under Wayland, set the environment variable
   NIXOS_OZONE_WL=1:

     * temporary fix: run via the terminal:

 $ NIXOS_OZONE_WL=1 code ...

     * permanent fix: add to your NixOS configuration:

 environment.sessionVariables.NIXOS_OZONE_WL = "1";

Updating extension versions

   Nixpkgs contains a script which will run code --list-extensions, then look
   for the latest available versions of those extensions, and output a list
   which you can add to your Nix config in a format similar to the above. To
   use it, clone the nixpkgs repo from GitHub, and run:
   nixpkgs/pkgs/applications/editors/vscode/extensions/update_installed_exts.sh

   Example output:

 ❯ ./nixpkgs/pkgs/applications/editors/vscode/extensions/update_installed_exts.sh
 ... # it does some fetching and then outputs the list...
 { extensions = [
   {
     name = "project-manager";
     publisher = "alefragnani";
     version = "12.4.0";
     sha256 = "0q6zkz7pqz2prmr01h17h9a5q6cn6bjgcxggy69c84j8h2w905wy";
   }
   {
     name = "githistory";
     publisher = "donjayamanne";
     version = "0.6.18";
     sha256 = "01lc9gpqdjy6himn7jsfjrfz8xrk728c20903lxkxy5fliv232gz";
   }
 ];
 }

Remote SSH

   The remote-ssh extension works by connecting to a remote host and
   downloading scripts and pre-built binaries to $HOME/.vscode-server. When
   first launching remote-ssh for a NixOS host, the connection will fail due
   to the provided node.js not having been built for a NixOS system (the
   dynamic libraries aren't in the same place).

  Any client to NixOS host

   tl;dr Use nix-vscode-server or nix-ld on host machines.

    nix-vscode-server

   Note that nix-vscode-server works as of 8/21/21 but is occasionally broken
   (See https://github.com/msteen/nixos-vscode-server/pull/3,
   https://github.com/msteen/nixos-vscode-server/pull/4,
   https://github.com/msteen/nixos-vscode-server/pull/5). Here's a
   workaround: Install the nodejs-16_x package on the NixOS host, and then
   run the following nix-shell script:

 #! /usr/bin/env nix-shell
 #! nix-shell --pure -i runghc -p "haskellPackages.ghcWithPackages (pkgs: [ pkgs.turtle ])"

 {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
 import Turtle

 main = sh $ do
   homedir <- home
   subdir <- ls $ homedir </> ".vscode-server/bin/"
   let nodepath = subdir </> "node"
   badnode <- isNotSymbolicLink nodepath
   if badnode
     then do
       mv nodepath (subdir </> "node_backup")
       symlink "/run/current-system/sw/bin/node" nodepath
       echo ("Fixed " <> repr subdir)
     else do
       echo ("Already fixed " <> repr subdir)

   If instead you'd prefer to fix the binaries manually and have to do so
   every time that you upgrade your VS Code version, then you can install the
   nodejs-16_x package on the NixOS host and replace the VS Code provided
   version. This workaround is described here:
   https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/648#issuecomment-503148523.
   Note that NodeJS needs to be updated according to VS Code upstream
   requirements (NodeJS 16 required from 4/2022).

    nix-ld

   Add the following settings to configuration.nix on the NixOS host

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

   programs.nix-ld.enable = true;

   Then run nixos-rebuild switch to enable nix-ld. Unlike the
   nix-vscode-server solution, the nix-ld solution also enables VSCode
   extensions even if they include non-Nix binaries.

  Nix-sourced VS Code to NixOS host

   If vscode-remote is installed from nix (vscode-extensions.ms-vscode-remote
   as above) on the client machine, everything should "just work".

Remote WSL

   Similar to SSH hosts, both nix-vscode-server and nix-ld solution allows a
   VSCode Windows client to connect a NixOS-WSL host. However, by default the
   VSCode Windows client uses wsl.exe --exec to start the code server, which
   bypasses NixOS environment variables required by nix-ld, resulting in
   failures.

   As a workaround, search for the following text in all files under the
   directory $HOME\.vscode\extensions\

 wslDaemon.js

 .push("sh","-c"

   Replace it with

 wslDaemon.js

 .push("sh","-l","-c"

   Then restart VS Code and your VS Code client should be able to connect to
   NixOS host

   See https://github.com/nix-community/NixOS-WSL/issues/222 for the
   discussion about wsl --exec issue on NixOS-WSL. See
   https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/8305#issuecomment-1661396267
   about the workaround.

Troubleshooting

  Error after Sign On

   If you get such an error after sign on in application:

 Writing login information to the keychain failed with error 'The name org.freedesktop.secret was not provided by any .service files'.

   Try to add the following setting in your system configuration (even if you
   don't use Gnome as desktop environment):

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 # needed for store VS Code auth token
 services.gnome.gnome-keyring.enable = true;

   Optional: add gnome.seahorse to environment.systemPackages to install GUI
   for GNOME Keyring.

   Don't forget to perform nixos-rebuild switch and reboot the system.

  Server did not start successfully

     Server did not start successfully. Full server log at
     /home/user/.vscode-server/.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.log

     server log:
     /home/user/.vscode-server/bin/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/bin/code-server:
     line 12:
     /home/user/.vscode-server/bin/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/node:
     No such file or directory

   "No such file or directory" means that libc is not found, see

 ldd ~/.vscode-server/bin/*/node

   try to run the node binary on the server

 ~/.vscode-server/bin/*/node

   if this fails, install node version 16, and try to patch the node binary

 nix-env -iA nixos.nodejs-16_x

 #! /bin/sh
 # fix-vscode-server-node.sh
 # https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/648#issuecomment-503148523
 cd ~/.vscode-server/bin/*
 if ! ./node -e "require('process').exit(0)"
 then
   echo patching node binary $(readlink -f node)
   rm node
   ln -s $(which node)
 else
   echo node is working $(readlink -f node)
 fi
