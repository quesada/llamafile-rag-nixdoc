   From NixOS Wiki

   Vivaldi is a web browser by the Norwegian company Vivaldi Technologies.

Installation

   add vivaldi to your environment.systemPackages and rebuild your system
   configuration.

Get it working with plasma 6

   Currently, vivaldi crash at startup on plasma6 due to improper
   packaging^[1], a workaround to this is to override the default package
   attributes by adding the following to your environment.systemPackages :

 (vivaldi.overrideAttrs
       (oldAttrs: {
         dontWrapQtApps = false;
         dontPatchELF = true;
         nativeBuildInputs = oldAttrs.nativeBuildInputs ++ [pkgs.kdePackages.wrapQtAppsHook];
       }))
