   Waydroid is an application which uses LXC containers to run Android
   applications on a non-Android system.

   Warning: Waydroid requires a Wayland desktop session and cannot be used on
   X11 directly, but can be run in a nested Wayland session, using e.g. cage.
   Warning: Installing Waydroid on your system before running
   nixos-generate-config will create unnecessary fstab entries that may
   interfere with system functionality.

Installation

   Enable Waydroid in your system configuration:

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 {
   virtualisation.waydroid.enable = true;
 }

   After rebuilding and switching, finish the Waydroid install in your shell.

 Fetch Waydroid images.
 You can add the parameters "-s GAPPS -f" to have GApps support.
 $ sudo waydroid init

   Before the following steps, you might need to do some GPU adjustments. See
   the troubleshooting section.

Usage

   Start the container

 Start the Waydroid LXC container
 $ sudo systemctl start waydroid-container

 You'll know it worked by checking the journal You should see "Started Waydroid Container".
 $ sudo journalctl -u waydroid-container

 Start Waydroid session
 You'll know it is finished when you see the message "Android with user 0 is ready".
 $ waydroid session start

   General usage

 Start Android UI
 $ waydroid show-full-ui

 List Android apps
 $ waydroid app list

 Start an Android app
 $ waydroid app launch <application name>

 Install an Android app
 $ waydroid app install </path/to/app.apk>

 Enter the LXC shell
 $ sudo waydroid shell

 Overrides the full-ui width
 $ waydroid prop set persist.waydroid.width 608

Maintenance

  Update Android

   Use following command to upgrade Android (LineageOS) to a newer version if
   available

 $ sudo waydroid upgrade

  Resetting Android Container

   Warning: All files of your Android container will be lost

 Stop Waydroid container
 $ sudo systemctl stop waydroid-container

 Removing images and user data
 $sudo rm -r /var/lib/waydroid/* ~/.local/share/waydroid

Troubleshooting

  GPU Adjustments

   In case you have an NVIDIA card or an RX 6800 series, you'll need to
   disable GBM and mesa-drivers:

 /var/lib/waydroid/waydroid_base.prop

 ro.hardware.gralloc=default
 ro.hardware.egl=swiftshader

  Linux 5.18+

   Linux 5.18 and later removed ashmem in favor of memfd, so you may need to
   tell Waydroid (1.2.1 and later) to use the new module:

 /var/lib/waydroid/waydroid_base.prop

 sys.use_memfd=true

  Changing keyboard layout

   According to an upstream issue, changing the keyboard layout doesn't seem
   possible at the moment.

  Missing UTF-8 support

   According to an upstream issue, Android might fail to display special
   characters correctly.

  Waydroid interferes with suspend/hybernation

   According to an upstream issue, Waydroid might interfere with suspend or
   hybernation. You might have to stop the Android session and container to
   suspend your machine correctly.

  Clipboard sharing

   Add wl-clipboard to environment.systemPackages.
