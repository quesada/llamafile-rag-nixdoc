Checking for Wayland

   To check if you are using Wayland, run the following command

 $ echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE

   If wayland is returned, you are running Wayland

Setup

   Two things are required for running Wayland: a compatible Display Manager,
   and a compatible Compositor.

Display Managers

   Display Managers are responsible for handling user login.

   The following Display Managers support using both X and Wayland protocols

    Graphical

     * gdm is the GNOME Display Manager.
     * sddm is the default Display Manager for KDE. Wayland support is
       currently experimental.

    Text-based

     * ly
     * emptty
     * lemurs

Compositors

   For the purposes of this basic overview, a compositor can be thought of as
   equivalent to an X Desktop Environment.

   Note: It is important to remember that this is not actually the case as
   there are multiple differences between how X and Wayland work internally

  Wayland Native

     * Sway is a i3-like compositor.
     * Hyprland the dynamic tiling Wayland compositor that doesn't sacrifice
       on its looks.

  X and Wayland support

     * Mutter is the default GNOME Desktop Environment/Compositor.
     * Plasma is the default KDE Desktop Environment/Compositor.

Applications

   Not all apps support running natively on Wayland. To work around this,
   XWayland should be enabled.

   Note: Enabling XWayland varies slightly from Compositor to Compositor, and
   may already be enabled. Consult your Compositor's documentation and/or nix
   file for how to enable

    Electron and Chromium

   As of NixOS 22.05 ("Quokka"), you can enable Ozone Wayland support in
   Chromium and Electron based applications by setting the environment
   variable NIXOS_OZONE_WL=1. For example, in a configuration.nix:

 environment.sessionVariables.NIXOS_OZONE_WL = "1";

   This allows these applications to run without Xwayland.
