   Wine is an application to run Windows applications and games.

32-bit and 64-bit Support

   On x86_64-linux, the wine package supports by default both 32- and 64-bit
   applications. On every other platform, the wine package supports by
   default only 32-bit applications.

   These defaults can however be overwritten like this:

 {
   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     # ...

     # support both 32- and 64-bit applications
     wineWowPackages.stable

     # support 32-bit only
     wine

     # support 64-bit only
     (wine.override { wineBuild = "wine64"; })

     # support 64-bit only
     wine64

     # wine-staging (version with experimental features)
     wineWowPackages.staging

     # winetricks (all versions)
     winetricks

     # native wayland support (unstable)
     wineWowPackages.waylandFull
   ];
 }

   If you get the error wine: '/path/to/your/wineprefix' is a 64-bit
   installation, it cannot be used with a 32-bit wineserver., then you need a
   64-bit build like wineWowPackages.

   The override method is mentioned in the manual.
