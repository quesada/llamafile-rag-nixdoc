Selinux

   Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a security architecture for Linux®
   systems that allows administrators to have more control over who can
   access the system. It was originally developed by the United States
   National Security Agency (NSA) as a series of patches to the Linux kernel
   using Linux Security Modules (LSM).

    Config Sample

  boot.kernelParams = [ "security=selinux" ];
  # compile kernel with SELinux support - but also support for other LSM modules
  boot.kernelPatches = [ {
         name = "selinux-config";
         patch = null;
         extraConfig = ''
                 SECURITY_SELINUX y
                 SECURITY_SELINUX_BOOTPARAM n
                 SECURITY_SELINUX_DISABLE n
                 SECURITY_SELINUX_DEVELOP y
                 SECURITY_SELINUX_AVC_STATS y
                 SECURITY_SELINUX_CHECKREQPROT_VALUE 0
                 DEFAULT_SECURITY_SELINUX n
               '';
         } ];
  # policycoreutils is for load_policy, fixfiles, setfiles, setsebool, semodile, and sestatus.
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ policycoreutils ];
  # build systemd with SELinux support so it loads policy at boot and supports file labelling
  systemd.package = pkgs.systemd.override { withSelinux = true; };
