   From NixOS Wiki
   Note: This package does NOT work if something like Home Manager is used to
   manage dotfiles!

   Wpgtk is a colorscheme, wallpaper and template manager for general *nix
   systems.

   It can easily be installed like any other package on NixOS by adding it to
   the environment.systemPackages in the /etc/nixos/configuration.nix, but it
   will also need the following option in the NixOS configuration to work:

 programs.dconf.enable = true;
