   xdebug is a PHP extension that helps with debugging PHP code.

Installation

   Configure your local apache/php to have the xdebug extension installed and
   enabled:

 # in /etc/nixos/configuration.nix (not inside systemPackages)
 services.httpd.phpPackage = pkgs.php.buildEnv {
     extensions = ({ enabled, all }: enabled ++ (with all; [
         xdebug
     ]));
     extraConfig = ''
         xdebug.mode=debug
     '';
 };

Usage

   In vscode open the debug panel and click "create a launch.json file" and
   click "PHP". The defaults work. Just click the green triangle "Listen for
   Xdebug".

   Edit a PHP file and add xdebug_break(); where you'd like the debugger to
   start.

   Point your browser at apache to get that PHP file to run in apache. Once
   that xdebug_break() xdebug will connect to vscode to initiate the
   debugging session. Once that connection is made you can make further
   breakpoints in vscode in the usual way (clicking to the left of the source
   code).

   See upstream xdebug documentation if you'd like other modes e.g. for PHP
   to connect to vscode and break/pause without the call to xdebug_break().
   The extraConfig string in the above example goes into php.ini.
