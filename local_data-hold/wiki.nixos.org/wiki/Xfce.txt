   From NixOS Wiki

   Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment based on GTK+. It includes a
   window manager, a file manager, desktop and panel.

   This article is an extension of the documentation in the NixOS manual.

Enabling

   To use xfce set services.xserver.desktopManager.xfce.enable to true. For
   example:

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 { config, pkgs, callPackage, ... }: {
   ...
   # if you use pulseaudio
   nixpkgs.config.pulseaudio = true;

   services.xserver = {
     enable = true;
     desktopManager = {
       xterm.enable = false;
       xfce.enable = true;
     };
     displayManager.defaultSession = "xfce";
   };
   ...
 }

    Tip                                                                       
    In order to affect your system by your nix-language-specific changes you  
    have to evaluate it, run (as root):                                       
                                                                              
    # nixos-rebuild switch                                                    

  Using as a desktop manager and not a window manager

   You can use xfce purely as a desktop manager, leaving window management to
   another window manager like i3 for example. In this scenario, xfce's role
   is to answer to media keys, prompt when plugging a new monitor and so on.

   Example config:

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 { config, pkgs, callPackage, ... }: {
   ...
   services.xserver = {
     enable = true;  
     desktopManager = {
       xterm.enable = false;
       xfce = {
         enable = true;
         noDesktop = true;
         enableXfwm = false;
       };
     };
     displayManager.defaultSession = "xfce";
     windowManager.i3.enable = true;
   };
   ...
 }

    Tip                                                                       
    In order to affect your system by your nix-language-specific changes you  
    have to evaluate it, run (as root):                                       
                                                                              
    # nixos-rebuild switch                                                    

   On first login, make sure to choose the session xfce+i3 in your display
   manager. If you choose xfce you will end up in xfce without panels nor
   window manager, which is unusable.

   Note that xfce manages your session instead of i3: exiting i3 will blank
   your screen but not terminate your session. In your i3 config, replace
   i3-msg exit with xfce4-session-logout.

    With xmonad as the window manager

   One of the possibilities is to use xmonad as a window manager in a Xfce
   desktop environment.

      Without xfce desktop

   The previously described configuration is extended with the part that
   configures xmonad:

 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

 { config, pkgs, callPackage, ... }: {
   ...
   services.xserver = {
     enable = true;  
     desktopManager = {
       xterm.enable = false;
       xfce = {
         enable = true;
         noDesktop = true;
         enableXfwm = false;
       };
     };
     windowManager = {
       xmonad = {
         enable = true;
         enableContribAndExtras = true;
         extraPackages = haskellPackages : [
           haskellPackages.xmonad-contrib
           haskellPackages.xmonad-extras
           haskellPackages.xmonad
         ];
       };
     };
     displayManager.defaultSession = "xfce+xmonad";
   };
   ...
 }

   Xmonad's contrib package comes with a config to integrate seamlessly into
   Xfce, like connecting workspaces to xfce's top panel's preview of
   workspaces. To enable this config, put the following into the user's
   xmonad config file:

 ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs

   import XMonad
   import XMonad.Config.Xfce
   main = xmonad xfceConfig
          { terminal = "xfce4-terminal"
          , modMask = mod4Mask -- optional: use Win key instead of Alt as MODi key
          }

   Since Xfce uses Alt for a lot of keybindings, using the Win key for xmonad
   hotkeys may be preferred.

    Tip                                                                       
    In order to affect your system by your nix-language-specific changes you  
    have to evaluate it, run (as root):                                       
                                                                              
    # nixos-rebuild switch                                                    

   After choosing the xfce+xmonad session in your display manager, you will
   be taken to a clean screen, where you can open a terminal with
   MOD+Shift+Enter or launch an application with MOD(+SHIFT)+p.

      With xfce desktop

   If you instead prefer to have panels (like the top panel) in addition to
   the main clean display area managed by xmonad, you can remove the
   xfce.noDesktop = true; option from the configuration.

    Tip                                                                       
    In order to affect your system by your nix-language-specific changes you  
    have to evaluate it, run (as root):                                       
                                                                              
    # nixos-rebuild switch                                                    

   After switching to your new configuration, reboot and clean your sessions
   with rm -rf ~/.cache/sessions/* before logging in to a graphical session.

   After logging in you will be greeted by xfce's desktop which interferes
   with xmonad. To solve this issue you have to remove the xfdesktop process
   from being started in the session. Open the session manager in the
   application launcher with MOD(+SHIFT)+p and then typing in "Session and
   Startup". Go to tab "Session" and set the restart style of xfdesktop to
   "Never". Kill the process with "Quit program", then "Save session." After
   this, xfce4 and xmonad will work together nicely.

      Java-based GUI applications

   Java-based applications may not work properly with xmonad. The
   applications main window may stay blank or gray on startup. This is a
   known issue with some versions of Java, where xmonad is not recognized as
   a "non-reparenting" window manager. There are multiple solutions to this
   problem as described on xmonad's FAQ page.

   One alternative is to fake xmonad's window manager name, after running the
   EMWH initialization. This particular approach works well when running
   xmonad alongside the xfce-based desktop (described above).

 ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs

     import XMonad
     import XMonad.Config.Xfce
     import XMonad.Hooks.EwmhDesktops
     import XMonad.Hooks.SetWMName

     main = xmonad xfceConfig
             { terminal = "xfce4-terminal"
             , modMask = mod4Mask -- Use Win as MOD key
             , startupHook = ewmhDesktopsStartup &gt;&gt; setWMName "LG3D" -- for some reason the double greater sign is escaped here due to wiki formatting, replace this with proper greater signs!
             }

      Additional resources

   Note that, unlike suggested in additional resources, the xmonad packages
   should not be installed in the environment (neither as systemPackages nor
   user packages), since that leads to errors when (re)compiling xmonad's
   config file.

Troubleshooting

  Pulseaudio

   If you use pulse audio, set nixpkgs.config.pulseaudio = true as shown
   above. Otherwise, you may experience glitches like being able to mute the
   sound card but not unmute it.
