   From NixOS Wiki

   ZNC is an IRC bouncer: it stays connected to IRC networks so clients can
   disconnect without missing messages or losing the session.

   Note: This page concerns NixOS 19.03 and later.

   Start with the following:

 services.znc = {
   enable = true;
   mutable = false; # Overwrite configuration set by ZNC from the web and chat interfaces.
   useLegacyConfig = false; # Turn off services.znc.confOptions and their defaults.
   openFirewall = true; # ZNC uses TCP port 5000 by default.
 };

   And use services.znc.config to configure ZNC as described in Configuration
   on the ZNC wiki.

Clients

   Choose a password, and extract a hash with:

 $ nix-shell --packages znc --command "znc --makepass"

   Then, in configuration.nix:

 services.znc.config = {
   LoadModule = [ "adminlog" ]; # Write access logs to ~znc/moddata/adminlog/znc.log.
   User.bob = {
     Admin = true;
     Pass.password = {
       Method = "sha256"; # Fill out this section
       Hash = "...";      # with the generated hash.
       Salt = "...";
     };
   };
 };

   SSL is enabled by default and a self-signed certificate is generated to
   ~znc/znc.pem. A fingerprint can be extracted with:

 cat ~znc/znc.pem | openssl x509 -sha512 -fingerprint -noout | tr -d ':' | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' | cut -d = -f 2

   Next, see Connecting and Category:Clients on the ZNC wiki.

Networks

   SASL authentication is not yet supported from configuration.nix. Either
   /msg *sasl ^[1] or use NickServ instead as shown below.

 service.znc.config.User.bob = {
   Network.freenode = {
     Server = "chat.freenode.net +6697";
     Chan = { "#nixos" = {}; "#nixos-wiki" = {}; };
     Nick = "bob";                             # Supply your password as an argument
     LoadModule = [ "nickserv yourpassword" ]; # <- to the nickserv module here.
     JoinDelay = 2; # Avoid joining channels before authenticating.
   };
 };
