   From NixOS Wiki

   Zed is a graphical text editor focusing on speed and collaborative
   editing.

   Its Linux support is fairly recent, the NixOS support even more so.

Installation

   The package zed-editor is available only from channel 24.11 onward.

   CLI support is installed and aliased to zeditor

LSP Support

   By default, Zed will try to download pre-built LSP servers in
   ~/.local/share/zed/languages/. This does not work for NixOS.

   There's sadly no way to inject those from $PATH for now. Worse, the way to
   point to the language server is language-specific, there is no global
   configuration flag for now.

   The following sections contain some language-specific setup working on
   NixOS.

  rust-analyzer

   Here, we'll assume rust-analyzer is globally installed in your system
   profile at /run/current-system/sw/bin/rust-analyzer. You may want to adapt
   this path in the following code snippet to something more relevant to your
   use case.

   Add the following snippet to your zed configuration file:

  "lsp": {
    "rust-analyzer": {
      "binary": {
        "path": "/run/current-system/sw/bin/rust-analyzer",
      },
    }
  }
