   From NixOS Wiki

   ZeroTierOne is the open source ethernet switch for the ZeroTier network.
   It is a way to connect devices over private networks anywhere in the
   world. Its done by creating a network and then joining two or more devices
   to that network.

Example config

 services.zerotierone = {
   enable = true;
   joinNetworks = [
     "6465f4ee45356976"
     "71e441cc137b93c8"
   ];
 };

   Warning: This configuration will automatically join networks, but will not
   leave them automatically. This still has to be done manually: see
   services.zerotierone.joinNetworks
