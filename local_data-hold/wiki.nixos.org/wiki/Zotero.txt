Zotero LibreOffice add-on

   Install either the community fork, or the official version of the plugin.
   The official version is included in zotero, located here:

 ${pkgs.zotero}/usr/lib/zotero-bin-7.0/integration/libreoffice/Zotero_LibreOffice_Integration.oxt

   This can also be done through nix build nixpkgs#zotero, then locating the
   file in result. Both plugins depend on a java runtime environment. Install
   pkgs.temurin-jre-bin-17 and select it from the list in the LibreOffice
   options at LibreOffice -> Advanced and restart LibreOffice.

Zotero Firefox add-on

   The Zotero Firefox add-on works as expected with one caveat; the pdftotext
   and pdfinfo plugins it needs in order to index and pull metadata from PDFs
   you wish to add to your library.

   The solution, for now, is as follows (this assumes that you have the
   Zotero plugin installed and configured sans PDF support): NB: The symlinks
   DO NOT survive an update between Firefox versions, so everytime your
   Firefox is updated you will have to repeat the below process! In your
   filesystem navigate to ~/.mozilla/firefox/<profile>/zotero Create the
   following symlinks and ensure that they are named EXACTLY as described
   here:

 ln -s /run/current-system/sw/bin/pdftotext pdftotext-Linux-<architecture> (e.g., pdftotext-Linux-x86_64)
 ln -s /run/current-system/sw/bin/pdfinfo pdfinfo-Linux-<architecture>

   Launch Firefox and go to the Zotero add-on preferences; click on the
   "Search" tab and you should find that both, pdftotext and pdfinfo, are
   recognized and their version is either "UNKNOWN" or the correct version
   number. This is trivial and should not deter you. You can now use the PDF
   metadata retrieval capabilities.
