   Zoxide is a smarter cd (change directory) command that supports all major
   shells.

Installation

   A basic user-specific installation with Home Manager may look like this:

 home-manager.users.myuser = {
   programs.zoxide.enable = true;
 };

   Change myuser to the username of the user you want to configure.

Shell Integration

   You can choose which shell integrations to enable with the
   enable*Integration options. By default all are enabled.

 programs.zoxide.enableBashIntegration= true;
 programs.zoxide.enableFishIntegration= true;
 programs.zoxide.enableNushellIntegration = true;
 programs.zoxide.enableZshIntegration = true;

   After adding Zoxide, you will have to restart your shell to gain access to
   the z command.

Extra Options

   You can pass extra flags to Zoxide using programs.zoxide.options as
   follows:

 programs.zoxide.options = [
   "--cmd cd"
 ];
